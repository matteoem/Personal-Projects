Stephen J Morley,5,"It’s huge, but it’s awesome.",the United States ,20201110,True,"  It’s a behemoth simple put. Besides that it is a really amazing console. Just setting it up and downloading a few games for my son, I could really notice the download speed and performance upgrades. Does not run hot so far it has been running terratech in 4K hdr for about half hour. See picture. The Xbox one x would easily hit 150 degrees Fahrenheit.",367,english
Meghan Pennington,5,I'm genuinely blown away.,the United States ,20201110,True,"  Let me start off by saying I am not an Xbox fan boy lol. I have mostly played PS4 and PC  in the past few years. I was very intrigued with Xbox series X because of the user experience. They really seem like they were listening with this generation and it shows. The UI interface is like butter it moves so quickly, with hardly any waiting. Game pass which is an amazing option only on Xbox and PC has an amazing selection of games right at my fingertips for a monthly fee. Xbox really got the user experience down I can honestly say that it was definitely worth it. I've been enjoying a lot of games that I played on PC and I am confident in saying that I have such a great experience on Xbox series X I'm blown away. It gets a little hot but I have it in a very breathable location. ( I would recommend that as well ) I'm excited to play all the Xbox one games I missed out on! (And new games of course) Overall I really recommend it.",174,english

I feel that’s a huge loss for Microsoft. Not really any reason to get this console until sometime next year when there will be some exclusives.

Kindle Customer,5,Xbox Series X Review,the United States ,20201110,True,"  To start off I would consider myself not a pro gamer, but definitely not a casual. I’m some where in between hardcore & Pro gamer. I got some insight on specs etc. This review will not be about the specs because we already know it’s damn better than last gen console Xbox One X.After a terrible, terrible, terrible...... the worst preorder experience of my life. I’m not joking. This generation of consoles preorders will go down in gaming history infamy because how bad it was, especially during our pandemic. I was as excited as I ever could be to receive this item as if I was a child all over again. And to top it all off it came 9 hours earlier on release day! I call that a significant win for preorder delivery, since this is my first time preordering a console online.Now for what your really here for, the console review. Personally, I love it. Load times are significantly faster! Games look so damn good! And total backwards compatibility with this console made me cry tears of joy. A true 4k experience. Something last generation promised us that didn’t happen.Now not anything is perfect. The one huge downside is there are no new games for this system yet. Usually there will be about 5 to 10 day one (some exclusive only to console) games. This year there’s basically 0. Yes, the positive spin on this is you have a while back catalog of older games you can play on this newer system and see the graphics ramped up. But as an avid gamer I am a Little disappointed that Microsoft the back big time even during pandemic that they couldn’t even offer at least 3 day one games. Sony is the same. These consoles will not have new games coming out day 1 unfortunately. We’ll have to wait till a little more in 2021 to expect the games we really want.If you want a more in-depth review you can head right on over to my YouTube channel where you can see an extensive review on the console today at 8pm central standard time. My dad and puppy will be on. It’l is going to be hilarious and cute. My channels name is Clive Childress. Come check it out of your interested to know more.All in all though this console is stellar. And I can’t fault the company for the pandemic situations. So with all that said this is a pretty great console.",92,english

A. Yates,1,Lemon,the United States ,20201113,True,"  Sad to give this a poor review.  I received a launch day unit which worked for three days and apparently died overnight.  No obvious reason for the death of the system but it simply won't turn on again.  MS support is sadly poor - just a circular loop back to the same canned and deficient ""support"" page, and an option to request a repair on the unit.  Says there's 24 hour online support, but I can't actually get it for this issue.  Likely returning it instead of requesting a repair.Prior to the hardware failure I was happy with the system.  As expected, load times were quite good, games looked great and were fluid.",34,english
Amazon Customer,1,Stopped working less than 4hrs after got it.,the United States ,20201111,True,  Everything was great then it just turned off and now it will not come back on.

Shawn P Vigneri,1,Launch day console = expensive brick,the United States ,20201111,True,"  I was very excited to receive my console on launch day after waiting 2 months from the pre-order. I was able to setup the console but it quickly died. The screen started flashing green then it shut off. After that it would either boot and then shut off after a minute or not boot at all. Lesson learned, don't buy the first generation of Microsoft's products!",30,english
Kris W,1,Don't buy digital games. Not possible for kids to play while I am.,the United States ,20201123,True,"  Over the years, I've invested in digital licenses for games.  felt like the future.  When the series x came out, I decided to give my xbox one S to my kids so they could play their games.  If we try to play at the same time, even though it is not the same game, we aren't allowed.  Okay... surely it will work if I sign in with my Kid's xbox live account that is connected to mine through family controls right?  Nope.  Maybe there is a way to loan the game or transfer the license?  Nope.  Basically I'm SOL, and will be looking for physical used games this holiday season for my kids.  The technology is ready for digital licensing, but MS is not.  I suggest buying physical (preferably used so it hurts their bottom line) until they empower digital owners.The series x itself has been fine.  Crashing a fair amount, but for now I blame that on COD:Cold War",26,english
Ian,5,Will only get better with software updates.,the United States ,20201110,True,"  The size of the console is so compact, it runs whisper quiet and improves upon most backward compatible titles.4K HDR, 120 FPS, 1440P support, even Dolby vision is supported on the console.You will get about 800GB usable space from the SSD for your games. Eventually you may have to spill for the 1TB sea gate expansion card. However, the best thing to do is use a USB 3.0 external HDD for your older games and put the new games on your main SSD.Currently there is an issue with VRR via HDMI at 4K. Variable refresh rate on certain TVs like LG and Panasonic. Microsoft is aware and will patch this via a software update. In the meantime, you can either turn VRR off on your Xbox video settings or run it at 1440p/1080p which works fine.Gamepass is the best value in gaming right now, Destiny 2 and the new expansion are on it.UI is running butter smooth and games are launching instantly. Right now there aren’t many new releases of games, but as time goes on there will be more titles to take advantage of this beast.Microsoft made an amazing console that will only age better over time.",24,english

Tom,1,Very disappointed. Major issues causing some games to be unplayable. Stutters and shuts down,the United States ,20201114,True,"  Have had major problems with this console. The disc drive doesn’t read discs after u turn the console off unless u eject and reinsert. Games like COD MW and Cold War lag incredibly bad to the point it’s unplayable due to the stuttering, yet when I try my Xbox one on the same tittles there is no lag at all. Lastly, my Xbox series x shuts completely down randomly in the middle of games - it’s done it 5 times sometimes back to back.Would not recommend buying until they patch all these problems (hopefully they can be patched",20,english
Zack Rowe,1,I wish I could give it 5 star but...,the United States ,20201118,True,"  Your browser does not support HTML5 video.   I wish I was able to give the Series X 5 stars but Microsoft customer service has killed it for me.A couple hours after receiving my Xbox it froze and after rebooting small pixel sized green squares littered the screen. I attempted swapping cables, changing TVs, and performing factory resets. In the end the issue would not go away.I decided to see if I could get a replacement through Amazon. Unfortunately they are currently out of stock. So the only option they provided was a refund or gift card.So I decided to give Microsoft support a shot, hoping that I could send it in for repair and get a replacement. This is where my journey of jumping hoops began.Microsoft only option for phone support is to fill out a form to have them call you, which is fine most of the time. After completing the form I was told I would receive a call in 90 minutes. 3 hours later I receive a call that the queue is full and my request was canceled. I would need to try again the next day.Next morning at 7am I refill out the form and receive a call from a human 2 minutes later. Woohoo! I explain my issues and the steps I took to trouble shoot. The service agent sets up a service request and says that I'll receive an email with what to do next.After hanging up and waiting a bit of time I receive the email and my shipping address is completely wrong from what I had told him on the phone....... So I hop online and resubmit the form to be called and I'm told it will be a 90 minute wait this time. 3 hours later I receive a call from a rep. I explain the mistake that was made on my address and he says that he needs to put me on hold so that he can escalate the issue. After being put on hold for 30 minutes  I abruptly get hung up on.After waiting to see if I would get a call back with no success I resubmit a request to be called online again. 4 hours later I get a call that the queue is full and my request has been canceled. I will need to try again tomorrow. I've owned every Xbox console that's been release and I would consider myself a bit of a fan boy. I shouldn't be required to jump through hoops like this when something doesn't work properly. This is EXTREMELY frustrating as a customer and has soured me a bit on the release of this console that I was super excited for a few months back.",20,english

SHA,1,Crashes!,the United States ,20201112,True,  My series X keeps crashing after a few mins of being turned on. I can just power it up and let it sit and it will power off completely without notice. Basically I have a very expensive paper weight! Smh!,19,english
Trenton P Mongillo,5,Amazing new gaming all in one system from Microsoft.,the United States ,20201110,True,"  Everything youve come to expect in a console launch. Polished hardware, subtle redesign of the included controller (1). Comes with a high speed hdmi 2.1 cable. The power brick is all internal and has a normal cable for power supply. If you are giving this as a holiday gift, consider powering it up before hand, it has approximately 900MB update to do right out of the box. The controller needs to be updated as well. You can use a smart phone and the xbox app to set up profiles and settings from your previous xbox one. You can also transfer your digital games from your xbox one over your own network instead of downloading them all from the xbox servers. Be warned! Digital game downloads can take hours to install depending on your internet connection.Great tech in this product. I like the future proof cables for when I decide to upgrade. Awesome form factor and it runs quiet and stays cool.Game pass is a must for xbox. Save thousands on games and have so many to choose from. With the latest additions of EA Play and Disney+ there is too much value for the consumer to pass up.",14,english

Irving Orozco,1,Sad,the United States ,20201113,True,  I pre order this item and once received two days later after release day I was really disappointed it would turn off on me out of nowhere and would not turn back on at all.

Used it for about 6 hours and I’ll say this console is a beast. Woke up the next day the console wouldn’t turn on at all tried all the troubleshooting steps and nothing. Decided to return it for my money back. Will wait until all the bugs are fixed with future series x consoles.,15,english
Thuy,1,Defective consoles rumor is true...,the United States ,20201122,True,  Console is defective. Turned it on to play for a few hours and it stopped working.

Anthony,5,Powerful and Quiet Console but don't buy from a scalper just wait,the United States ,20201111,True,"  Great console, easy to set up (it's fast if you use the Xbox App didn't try the other normal way). If you're an everyday Xbox player, once set up, everything is familiar and ready to go. Truly feels like a PC upgrade more than a console upgrade with how smooth everything is.Also don't buy from scalpers, just wait, you're not missing anything even remotely worth the price they are charging.",12,english

T. A. Ashley,4,"Despite problems on the delivery side, this console really...uh...delivers.",the United States ,20201122,True,"  Let me get the ugly out of the way first. The industry as a whole completely botched the release of this generation of consoles. Pandemic aside, supply was nowhere near adequate to demand and very likely should have waited until late Winter/early Spring 2021 to launch. Additionally, internet commerce infrastructure was wholly inadequate to handle orders, particularly ones plagued by shopping bots used by scalpers to scoop up the already limited supply and sell them for outrageous markups. Let's hope this was a learning experience for everyone, and measures are being put in place to avoid this from happening in the future. Since this isn't a review of the industry, it won't affect my final score. But it all bore saying nonetheless.Right then, that out of the way... Despite my September 22 pre-order being delayed delivery by a day, my Series X arrived on November 11. Microsoft did an admirable job with the packaging, and the unboxing felt like an event. Once you broke the transparent seals on the box, the lid lifted like a treasure chest, the XBox nestled in thick packing foam on either side and from the lid above. The console was carefully wrapped in thin black paper-foam with an black and green banner around it that boldly invited you to ""Power Your Dreams!""Set-up was a breeze. The Series X comes complete with HDMI 2.1 cable for 4K UHD display, power cord (and no ungainly brick this time), and of course the evolutionary Series controller. With everything connected, the first powerup was exciting. The new splash screen is powerful, reminiscent of the old THX sound intro that is truly amazing if you have the volume turned up. Once setup begins in earnest, you can continue either using the controller or by coupling the console with the new XBox app on your phone. I encountered a few issues using the phone app (which is still listed as a beta on the android market), so I continued the setup with the controller. It went without a hitch and plugged all my old XBox One settings in through the miracle of the Cloud. I also plugged in my external HDD, and it happily recognized all my old games.The user interface is like the return of a familiar old friend. It's very much like the latest iteration on the XBox One family, and you'll be right at home from the very beginning. I know a common complaint is that it didn't seem ""next gen enough"" for many, but there's something to be said for being able to navigate a new device without having to learn all the new nooks and crannies they've shuffled things into. The first thing you'll notice is how fast the UI is now. ""Snappy"" is a term often used to describe how it feels. There's no lag in moving from section to section, button presses register immediately and there's the sense that the whole UI has had a quiet yet unmistakable injection of horsepower. The store, rather than appearing tacked-on and sluggish, comes up post haste. Overall the system is very responsive, and a pleasure to use.Of course, the system really shines if you have Game Pass. Those new to XBox who take advantage of the Game Pass introductory offer will be treated to over a hundred titles you can immediately download and play. Additionally, EA Play and Microsoft teamed up, so the player has access to dozens more games from the EA library. Sports titles like Madden and FIFA, old school RPG's like the Dragon Age series and much more are at your fingertips. Many titles either already have been enhanced to take advantage of the Series S/X feature set, or are currently being updated for the very same.Now, all of this is to dance around the very obvious omission in the Series launch: a lack of original and unique launch titles. Halo Infinite was to be that vehicle for Microsoft, but after this Summer's lackluster presentation, the game was delayed until 2021. Its absence is keenly felt in the marketing and product packaging which still prominently features Master Chief as its launch mascot.That said, the future looks bright indeed for the XBox. Microsoft's manic acquisition of studios, not least of which is the still-pending Zenimax deal, promises some console exclusives that are truly ground-breaking. Between Bethesda's rich legacy in the Elder Scrolls and Fallout, Arkane and id Software, and much more, there is an embarrassment of riches on the horizon for XBox players, as well as PC and mobile gamers who plug into the Game Pass content conduit.That's all fine and well, but launch exclusives aside, how does it play games? The answer is, ""Quite well, actually!"" Those titles explicitly enhanced to take advantage of the new consoles' power are vibrant, buttery-smooth at 60 (or even 120 in some instances) frames per second, and a joy to both behold and to experience. Even older legacy titles from the original XBox and 360 eras can take advantage of the raw power that the Series brings to bear, with many benefiting from graphical upscaling, auto-HDR, and other behind-the-scenes enhancements. If you've been immersed for years in the XBox culture, you have likely amassed quite the library of games, the vast majority of which are playable on the new hardware.Finally, the new controller as has been mentioned previously, is more evolutionary than revolutionary. The back of the shell has a textured ""grippy"" new feel to it, as have the shoulder- and trigger buttons. The D-pad now features more of an 8-way control surface rather than the more familiar 4 cardinal directions. The sticks also have a slightly different feel and grip; not so much that it's unfamiliar, but it's noticeable nevertheless. A downside is Microsoft's insistence on not shipping the controller with a rechargeable battery. It takes two ""AA"" cells, and to be fair it's pretty conservative on power draw with a fresh pair of alkalines lasting a good many hours of play. And you can buy the branded recharge kit for an additional $25-ish, but seriously in this day and age, it should come as standard equipment. Luckily, the controller is so similar to the XBox One's controller, that many of the latter's add-ons work perfectly well on the new one. I swapped the recharge pack from my XBO's controller with no issue, and aside from requiring a USB-C cable rather than the older micro-USB connector, it works just fine. The same is true of the headset adapter that plugs into the bottom of the unit. It works without a hitch, which suits me just fine.OK, final verdict. The Series X is a great powerhouse of a next gen console. While Game Pass is a great deal and I can heartily recommend it, the new consoles are at time of launch a weapon in search of a war. With no new titles to really showcase the new features of the console, the whole experience, while somewhat satisfying, feels a bit hollow. I'm sure once the new titles start flowing in the coming months and years, the true value of the Series consoles will shine forth, but if it's a ""fear of missing out"" experience, I can honestly recommend you wait until availability and new titles can be brought together next year. For that reason, as of the date of writing this (November 22, 2020), I'm reserving one star from the review in the hopes that once those new titles arrive I can revise the review and give the XBox Series X the 5-stars it rightly deserves.Now if I could only get my hands on a Playstation 5... ugh. *rolls eyes*",8,english
josh Rosenblatt,1,Xbox series X stopped working and will not turn on!,the United States ,20201112,True,  Worked for 1 day. Then it shutdown and never turned on again.  Already sent it back to Microsoft for replacement.  We will see how long that takes...,15,english
Truitt Wilson,5,"Amazing performance, amazing design, and incredible value",the United States ,20201114,True,"  Design:Smaller than you expect for a console that has this kind of performance.Controller:Feels great in your hand, has better latency than any previous xbox controller. Pairs and connects to the Xbox when powering on nearly instantly, which is a nice improvement from previous controllers.Performance:The level of graphical quality, FPS, and speed of the SSD make this the best console on the market. It accomplishes this all while being dead quiet and impressively cool.Features:Microsoft's implementation of Quick Resume and the velocity architecture makes switching between multiple games a breeze and actually incentives you to try different titles. The thoughts of not wanting to load up a new game because it would take too long to load up are gone forever with this generation.Conclusion:Microsoft has pulled out all the stops hardware and OS-wise. Once next generation games come out, the Xbox Series X will be the best way to game for years to come.",7,english

berner,5,Tower of power,the United States ,20201113,True,"  Your browser does not support HTML5 video.   Absolutely love this console and I gotta say I'm lucky to have been able to pre order and have it arrive on time. One of the game changing feature for me is the quick resume. With this you can have multiple games running and going back into them right where you left off(without having to load into the game again). Also gamepass is a no brainer especially since games are bumping up in price to $70. With gamepass, all Microsoft exclusives are FREE! You also have a vast selection of games including ea play. Lastly, the graphics and speed of this console are amazing. I'm currently playing ac Valhalla and load times are just a bit behind that of ghost of tsushima but with even better visuals. Also the simplicity of the ui and controller are the things I love most about xbox. All in all I'm more than glad I purchased this console!",3,english
David,5,Absolutely stunning,the United States ,20201111,True,"  As soon as I opened the package I was in awe with how beautifully it was packaged, it’s super solid and sturdy. Plugging it in was very easy, no more power bricks, just one cord straight from the Xbox to the wall. Turned it on and it was like magic. Instantly started downloading games, and they look stunning! I have played Forza Horizon 4, Fallout 4, Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order, and Dirt 4, and each load super quick. Huge leap from the load times of the Xbox one. In fallout 4, I can fast travel and have it loaded to the next place in about 5 seconds. Graphics of optimized games such as Forza look so much better than I expected. Everything is super fast, next to no wait times, and runs super smoothly. Quick resume works very well, loads back into the game within 10 seconds right where I left off. Controller feels very good in my hands, textured triggers are amazing. Super simple setup, gorgeous graphics, very short load times, very very smooth gameplay. All in all, was 1000x better than expected. Couldn’t be happier. I use a 27” 4K monitor.",3,english

It is back in stock and you are reading this review as it goes back out of stock. Good job wasting time.",4,english
Foxfen,4,A+ box presentation!,the United States ,20201113,True,"  So, yeah, new generation of hardware from Microsoft but can I talk about that box?  Because that was a spectacular way to jump into the next Xbox.You open the box up and there is the Series X all wrapped up like it's in a treasure chest.  It was great!  I actually had to take some video of it because it was above and beyond what I expected from unboxing a new console.  So good job on that!I'm upgrading from an Xbox One S and from that perspective, it was definitely time to upgrade.  I've got this 4K TV without a system that properly utilizes it!  I held off on getting a One X because I knew the next Xbox system would be coming out soon enough.And here it is.Visually speaking, I'm not really noticing TOO much difference from games on the One S.  There are some added details on some of my old games to upgrade them to 4K and I notice some effects that weren't there before.  Everything is less fuzzy.  So that's good.  It's just not the same as the visual jump from the NES to the SNES.  Or the Playstation to the Playstation 2.  But it IS close to the leap from the Xbox 360 to the Xbox One.  The difference there was only noticeable a few years after the fact for me.  I imagine the same will be true here, especially since most of the games I'm playing right not are Xbox One games upgraded to 4K and not native Series X games, beyond Yakuza: Like a Dragon.And that details the biggest drawback to getting a Series X at launch: lack of a strong exclusive library of games.  While the Playstation 5 has Spider-Man: Miles Morales, Godfall, and Sackboy, there isn't anything on the Xbox that can't be played on the PS5 except Yakuza: Like a Dragon (and that can probably be played as a PlayStation 4 game through backwards compatibility).  With Halo Infinite being delayed, there's no massive reason to upgrade your hardware.Well... I SAY that but I also don't regret doing so.  I'm disappointed in the lack of exclusives but the 4K is still very nice.  And it isn't even the best part of the Series X.  That would be the load times.  With the new hardware and the new memory storage system, games load incredibly fast.  I used to start a game up and then head into the kitchen to grab a drink or whatever while the console booted things up but those days are done.  This thing zips along.  That also applies while you're in the game.  Reloads and fast travels, even cut-scenes, happen swiftly.  There's a lot of power in this rectangular box.  The Playstation 5 also has super fast load times so it's not a selling feature if you're comparing consoles but, on its own, it presents a compelling case.It's a lot of the ""under-the-hood"" features that build this system up as a good replacement for your Xbox One.  The fact that it is capable of playing a large number of Xbox's back catalog going all the way back to the original Xbox means you'll have a huge library of games to play even if they aren't brand new exclusives.  I've got a serious backlog of titles so playing them in 4K and getting into my games faster is fine for me right now.  If you are a Gamepass subscriber, you have a large library of games to choose from right out of the gate, including a lot of EA games added from their EA Play subscription service.  I spent my first day just downloading everything I'm going to be wasting my time on over the next few months.And, let me be clear: if you play on Xbox, do yourself a favor and subscribe to Gamepass.  You get some great games and many of them are upgraded to take advantage of the Series X.  It's a good deal.I'm happy with my purchase.  I wish Halo would have made launch.  I'm also happy they held it back so that when it releases, it's worth playing.  But, man, launch would have made this purchase a lot more palatable.  In the end, it comes down to where your friends are.  Mine are on Xbox so here I am.  This thing is a powerhouse and I doubt I'm going to regret having it a year or so down the line.But if you have to make a choice between this and the Playstation 5 and you don't really do online gaming with your friends, the Playstation 5 makes a more compelling case this holiday season.  Miles Morales looks really good.But if Sony's exclusives don't move you, the third party games are all multiplatform.  You can enjoy your Call of Dutys and your Assassin's Creeds on whatever console you manage to get.  In 2020, I think we could all use a win and I think there's enough to keep you busy on both consoles to check that win box.Oh! This thing also has a controller!  It is pretty much exactly like the Xbox One controller which was a slight upgrade from the 360 controller... which was an upgrade from the Xbox S controller.  This is my favorite controller layout and it feels as comfortable in my hands as the XB1 version.  There's a capture button now to take pictures and video which is something Sony added with the PlayStation 4 and Nintendo added on the Switch.  So Microsoft is a little behind but it's here now!  I have not used it yet but I'm sure I'll get around to it.Anyway, welcome to the next generation of video game hardware.  This thing is a beast of tech and should prove a worthwhile purchase. In time.  Day one, you know what you're getting: an I.O.U. note promising better things to come.But, man, that treasure box opening is pretty great. ;)",1,english
John Smith,1,"DOA, terrible customer service. I should have bought a PS5",the United States ,20201207,True,"  When I got it games would shut off either immediately or within the hour. I don't know what was wrong, I think it had a faulty power supply. I sent it back; took more than two weeks to get it back with expedited service that I paid an extra $10 for. I received the HDMI and AC power cord a week later in a different box, and I've yet to get the controller back; it's been 4 weeks.I could have purchased a PS5 and I wouldn't have had any of these problems.

JGtzTop Contributor: Cooking,5,Nice Evolution but wait a year,the United States ,20201228,True,"  I've been playing Xbox since the OG version back in the early 2000's, the 360 was a nice leap from that OG version, the One was a good evolution from the 360, and now the XSX is further refinement. There's nothing really revolutionary especially if you're coming from the Xbox One X that had a powerful GPU already.Launch game list is atrocious, nothing really great to captivate the Xbox faithful. In the month and a half that I've had this console I've played Rocket League, Cyberpunk, Ori, GOW 5, Gears Tactics - they look nice but really can't see a difference compared to my One X graphically. Of course, there's the much better load times, instant game boot up and general quitness to the console which are a great improvement but is it worth $500 over the $500 I paid 2-3 years ago for the One X? Not really.Overall, I am an early adopter of tech, I've had all the day one editions since the 360 so I am a beta tester of sorts - I do anticipate the XSX to get better starting in 2021 with more first party games takind advantage of the the strong GPU and SSD performance. But for now, if you're a casual gamer like me or have the Xbox One X I would say to hold off until mid-late 2021. If you are rocking the Xbox One or Xbox One S then this is a worthy upgrade just for the visual upgrades and speed improvements.I play on a 65"" LG CX Oled TV via HDMI 2.1 cable, hopefully in 2021 more TVs are able to take advantage of all the tech the XSX offers for cheaper.",1,english

AmazonAJ,5,The monolith of POWER!,the United States ,20201212,True,"  I've grown up mostly a Playstation gamer...ps1 to ps4. I had and enjoyed xbox 360 but PS was my go to.  That all changed when I bought the xbox one x and tried gamepass. What a game changer that combo was for me quite literally. The one x played 3rd party games better than the competition and gamepass was an incredible value. Backward compatibility was the bonus. I loved it.Series X continues that power and value proposition without the mistakes xbox made with the xbox one launch. Microsoft and xbox have really turned it around and have once again produced the monolith of power with Series x.Fast ssd, super smooth menus, 1440p/4k support, variable refresh rate, auto low latency, hard drive support, backwards compatible with games and accessories, gamepass, games optimized for series x or s, familiar yet just better controller, external ssd expansion card available, auto hdr... you get the drift.The series X is best most complete xbox I dare say ever produced. If your already an xbox gamer its a no brainer to upgrade... if your thinking about making the switch... this is the best xbox to get onto to.Its familiar yet improved in every way. The library of exclusives can and will get better but with optimized series x games and gamepass you'll be plenty busy.Happy gaming!",1,english
Revan_Deschain,1,"Stuck at 640x480 resolution, tried everything - no solutions work",the United States ,20201212,True,"  This console obviously needed further bug testing. After FINALLY getting my day 1 preorder, I was ecstatic. My mood quickly sullied when about a week after purchasing, for some reason the console would be set at 640x480 resolution, with no fix available. The ""solutions"" online do not work, and there's no official word from Microsoft. This is NOT a TV issue. My Xbox One, PS4 and Switch all work perfectly fine. It's just the Series X. It apparently doesn't matter what kind of TV you have, it affects a whole bunch of them. A total headache. You should wait for the Xbox Series XYZ to come out in a year - maybe that one will actually work as advertised. I'm going to try to go about getting a refund.",3,english

DizzyUnbound,5,Great so far!,the United States ,20201113,True,"  I normally like to wait a bit before giving my review, but I just couldn't wait to mention some things here.This thing is silent. Like.. DEAD silent. My Xbox One X would get sorta loud running BO4 and no doubt would running Cold War, but this thing is very quiet, unless you lean up really close to the top.Contrary to some articles, this thing doesn't really get too hot either. It gets warm, obviously, but it's definitely not as bad as some sources say it is.The d-pad of the controller was a bit of a worry for me when I saw it in photos. But using it just feels so right. The inclusion of a USB-C slot on the controller is also a nice touch. I have mispressed the share button a few times, but when I get a feel for where it is, it's gonna be a game changer.My only gripe so far is that I'm worried something might get into the top part where the fan is and mess everything up. And the power cable felt a tad loose, but nothing worth fretting about too much.All in all, first impressions are really good. If I remember, I'll try to update in a couple months if anything changes. Definitely recommend if you're a fan of Xbox and console gaming as a whole.",1,english
whiskeyfoy,4,7 hours of pure Joy.. Until it wasn't. c'est la vie,the United States ,20201112,True,"  I will start by stating I know the risks of being one of the first to get new tech.  So take my review with a grain of salt.  If you are reading this 6 months from now you probably are fine.  I am giving 4 stars because I feel the early release pains are more on the company and not the product.My review is that the Xbox delivers on what it said it would.  It is crazy powerful and just runs games beautifully.... For the short amount of time it did that.  There I was, in the middle of a 10 kill Warzone Trios making sick comms, about to secure another W all while saying ""If they only knew it was on the new Xbox"" then all of a sudden... bewp... Series X Series-ly shut down out of no where.  Not just a casual bye, no, like an angry significant other coming in and saying ""You're still playing that game?!?"" and slamming the door in your face.  I tried a number of things to get the Xbox to come back to me.  I sang it a song, tucked it in, promised I would buy every Microsoft exclusive game.  But alas nothing worked.  I now have a very, plain looking, desk weight.  Now I get to go through the fun and lengthy warranty return process with good ol big brother Microsoft.  I will take solace in the few short hours I got to brag and make fun of the ""one'ers"" who couldn't get their hands on one, but will likely have a working console before I get my replacement.

Frank,4,Xbox,the United States ,20201111,True,  Heavy unit and big! But not as big as I imagined (pc gamer usually). Runs games smooth and responsive. The UI is much quicker than xbox one.Yakuza game looks beautiful on it. And waiting for cyber punk. The new controller doesn't work with some of my older recharge xbox one battery packs. Luckily. I have rechargeable AAs.Def feels like a nice upgrade from xbox one but if you dont have the money. Don't rush into buying one yet.,3,english
Mario,3,Got a dud,the United States ,20201202,True,"  My XBSX had trouble connecting to 5Ghz wifi and would turn off on its own after just minutes of gameplay on any game. Really sucks, sent it in for repair/replacement this morning.Also, i dont like how it doesnt feel like an upgrade cause of the UI.

FloridaJay!,4,Meh.. just another Xbox...,the United States ,20201112,True,"  So far not super impressed with this new Xbox. Yes it’s a sexy piece of electronic and seems built solid but the lack of launch games is disappointing. I also don’t see that much of a performance difference between my Xbox one x and this as far as speed etc. maybe because it’s due to lack of games but right now, they are way behind PS5 launch. Very disappointed and not so sure it’s worth the hype..",3,english
Trkoyse,5,Next-gen in Subtle ways (as of right now),the United States ,20201205,True,"  Coming from an Xbox One X I can say this does feel like a next-gen leap, albeit not a huge one as of yet.The console is quiet, and the use of an SSD this generation means a very responsive UI and faster load times for games. There are a handful of Series X optimized games available but not a bunch. I bought Devil May Cry 5 Special Edition to go with this and the differences are noticeable. In addition to improved graphics and faster load times the Series X also beings Ray Tracing which made this particular game look even better.To summarize the console delivers on bringing a next-gen feel and if you have a One X already there are differences that make the purchase feel welcome. Granted, with the short supply of games out there using this to its fullest at this time, you would be forgiven for waiting a little longer to buy this. But for those that buy it now or plan to buy it, I can definitely recommend this.",1,english
Keith M,5,Lots of potential.,the United States ,20201121,True,"  I'm one of those gamers that buys both Sony and Microsoft systems each go 'round. With the XSX, presentation was everything. From opening up the box and seeing how MS wrapped the XSX, it felt like I bought a premium product. Power up your new system, and you can transfer your existing content over in a flash. I love the SSD, and how quickly everything boots up compared to the previous  One X/S...Seeing NBA 2K21 upgraded is amazing! It's like a totally new game from the One X/S version I was playing. The XSX is whisper quiet..You'll barely notice it's on. Gamepass ultimate is an amazing bargin! My only wish is that MS had some New launch games, but with 2020 being what it is, I understand...I'll still enjoy the games I recently purchased, and the upgraded games like MK11, NBA 2K21, MADDEN 21, COD MW, ORI, AND FORZA HORIZON 4..The future is bright .",1,english
Maria,5,"Fast, quiet, powerful! What more can you ask for? Better design maybe. Best console ever made?",the United States ,20201113,True,"  Excellent is the best word to describe this xbox series x. I been a gamer since the 1980s and this is by far the best console ever created. Lets take a look at some pros and cons and also why I think its better then ps5.ProsIts fast! When I say fast I really mean FAST. Loads games in 5 seconds flat, menu system is snappy etc.It's powerful! The few games available to try right now that are optimized for the series x look very good and you can tell the future will bring alot of good high end graphics to consoles finally!Great selection of games thru game pass. And its backwards compatible with all Xbox games from previous consoles.ConsSo far there's only 2.1. I think they could of did better with the controller.  Although I still believe xbox controller is better then the competition in layout and thumb sticks etc. the plastic just feels cheap. The better grip and dpad is nice but the overall feel is cheap. Theres a small lip at the top that gives it a unfinished feeling. Also no rechargeable battery is a bummer as well.. Ps5 controller just looks way better and more of a future look to it.2. The system is bulky and looks like a fridge or just a big black box. The insides alot of work went into to develop a closed system with good cooling and a monster fan which is quiet and I appreciate that but the design is not good.Ps5 design is definitely better.Now why do I feel the series x is better then ps5. It all comes down to a few things.1. It's a bit more powerful2. Better online game library with gamepass.3. Better mobile play options with being able to play straight on your mobile phone or laptop or pc gives the xbox an advantage.If you always been a Playstation guy and all your friends are on there I can see sticking with ps5. But if you don't care about friends and want a bit better experience with ability to play your games even on the go then xbox is the moveI know this is a long review but I feel microsoft deserved it since they did a hell of a job with this system and I highly recommend it to anyone.If your a gamer and thinking of switching from pc to a new console then this would be the one I recommend.",1,english
sue boyd,5,I must have been nicer than I thought....,the United States ,20201215,True,"  ...for Santa to let me buy this. First off, I understand that I got extremely lucky and happened to see a surprise shipment of these that Amazon got the first week of December. I was able to buy it at MSRP and received my series X the next day. And WOW. I love this console. The load times are non existent. I have a low latency 4k TV and the image is amazing! Even early Cyberpunk runs perfect with nearly no load times. I have been gaming since the first NES came out in the 80s and this is the most polished gaming console I've ever experienced. I know others may have issues and the war with PS5 will be brutal... but I am having a blast. So far there isn't a single thing I'd change. X Series and Gamepass is the best gaming value this year.",1,english
Gman,5,Most powerful Xbox I ever owned. Its a good system for retro Xbox gamers.,the United States ,20201122,True,"  I only had this for a few days and so far I love the system. It sits 6 feet away from me and I can not hear it. It is so quiet. I was originally was going to get the Xbox One X in 2018 to replace my Xbox One Launch version but so glad I held off as the XSX is able to run older games nearly at the intended locked framerate with rarely any drops like the Xbox One X. I pulled out some of my old favorite Original Xbox, Xbox 360 and Xbox one games and they all look better with a more stable framerate, a higher resolution with higher amounts of AF.All in all the system is lighting fast. Usually, with load screens, I would pull out my phone or walk away to do something else. With this system, you really cannot do that anymore due to the lightning-fast SSD. The Xbox dashboard is very snappy like modern high-end smartphones. I am very glad I didn't get the Xbox1x and got this. The controller is similar to the Xbox One controllers but it has a textured backside. The triggers also feel more solid.Lastly, I'm not one to do game subscriptions but GamePass is very enticing at $15 per month. I'm planning to sign up by the end of the month.All in all, it's a good value if you have a 4K display. Coming from a Steam PC gamer Im very impressed with the system.",1,english
Trevor D.,5,Like a cat at 3 A.M.,the United States ,20201112,True,"  The new Series X is absolutely amazing. It's super fast and responsive, makes everything look better on a 4k TV (even non-120Hz tv's), and was SUPER EASY TO SET UP via the Xbox app. Even progressing from the One X, it is very easy to see the difference. It's larger than I expected, but still fits nicely among the atmosphere. The quick resume feature lives up to its name, and I highly recommend it for anybody looking to upgrade their current Xbox experience.For those that were unfortunate enough to get screwed out of launch day pre-order, it is absolutely worth the struggle and frustration.Can't recommend enough! Just don't vape into it.",2,english
Lee,5,Worth every penny and more,the United States ,20201110,True,  I have zero complaints about this console and if you like the Xbox one x then you will absolutely love this Xbox.

Mandie,5,Well worth it!,the United States ,20201127,True,"  Coming from the Xbox One X I have personally noticed a giant different in smoothness and image quality with Gears 5. I played in awe the entire way through the game on the Series X. It’s a beautiful machine that performs well, and it has surpassed all of my expectations. Assassins Creed Valhalla was the game that really impressed me the most on performance mode. Any worries about no true next gen games went right out the window after playing this game. All games load super fast and it is fantastic. I’m used to loading a game, picking my phone, up and scrolling through social media, etc. With the Series X a game will load so fast that by the time I pick my phone up and open an app that I put it down right away, because I’m in the game already. Each game differs in loading time but boy this machine is fast. Quick Resume works well on older games, and another added bonus. The 4K player plays my movies and they look and sound beautiful as well. It’s also silent to my ears and it lives up to its hype. This was also a preorder and Amazon delivered on launch day and even early in the day as well.",0,english

TJ,5,Team Xbox Delivers on the Series X,the United States ,20201111,True,"  Shipping and Delivery: My Series X came on launch day as promised. The main box was in a brown padded shipping box. Shout out for that to Amazon. It gives me faith in their shipping process, and with their shipping partner. In my case it was UPS. My personal experience anyways.The Gaming Experience: As for the console, it’s a real monster. It’s like upgrading your PC after 7 years. An instant feeling of power, speed snd graphical output. So yes, you will notice the difference in power, big time, going from the Xbox One to the Series X especially. It’s quick and snappy. The SSD delivers, giving an instant boot up and extremely quick loading times in titles across the generations, whether it’s from 5 years ago or this week. This holds true especially in Series X|S optimized games. I decided to break it in with two games AC: Valhalla and Doom Eternal. It’s as promised. Richer, more dynamic worlds. Fluid frame rates. I couldn’t praise it enough. Ever want to know what a game feels like on a top of the line gaming PC but through the console experience? Series X will deliver on that. I couldn’t be more pleased.The Build: Again, Team Xbox delivered. A solid 14 pounds. So no small console. But it’s top notch in build quality. Heavy, sturdy and striking. I personally believe it’s the finest looking piece of tech in my house. It keeps asking for me to appreciate it as it sits silently in the corner, and each time I turn my head to give it that appreciation. The Series X looks like the premium 500 dollar device it is marked as. Hands down.",1,english
Rodney Peterson,5,Next-Gen Done and Begun Right,the United States ,20201127,True,"  Back in 2013, both Microsoft and Sony launched the Xbox One and PlayStation 4 (respectively). Compared to the generation prior (Xbox 360 and PS3) and how those compared to current PC's of the day, the seventh console generation did not start well. From false promises from Mark Cerny about the PS4 hitting 1080p and 60FPS for every game, to Microsoft's loss of focus on gaming... couple that with the less than impressive comparison to PC's, and you would find the apology for sale a few years later with the PS4 Pro and Xbox One X. Those were what we should have gotten to kick of a generation.Now here we are in 2020. The only downside has been acquiring one of the consoles and the lack of supply due to COVID-19. The Xbox Series X (seriously, Microsoft needs to do something about the naming) is a great offering with great value tucked away inside of the Xbox service.Without getting deep into the technical specs, I will highlight some key differences between the Series X and the One X. The SSD is first. Fast load times across the board for games and the system itself. The 1TB is not what you get in full, but it is not an issue if you keep a small catalogue of installed games. Currently with 6 games installed (AC: Valhalla, Destiny 2 ((all expansions)), GTA V, Red Dead Redemption 2 and Watch Dogs Legion), i am sitting at 357.5GB of free space. The frame rates are great with the ability to keep a steady 60FPS and achieve up to 120FPS. 4K is glorious with HDR. The Ray Tracing that some games have is a really nice touch, but unless you stop to smell the roses (or in this case the, wander up and stare at them), it doesn't jump out at you.Otherwise the console is impressive. Not a single sound has come from the machine in my few hours (extended this evening) of play time. The start up speed is incredibly fast and this is both from a fresh boot, to the low-power mode, to the unplugging method. Quick Resume is something to appreciate as well. Being able to have a handful of games running at once is a nice feature especially if you are one who has game ADD, or want to hop back into a single-player game after having a multiplayer session with friends.The new controller is built on the old saying, ""If it ain't broke, don't fix it."" While Sony went with a new design and functionality for the PS5 with the DuelSense controller (seriously the haptic feedback is a cool addition, but I have a weird feeling it will fade out at some point), I can't help but feel Microsoft kinda missed a chance with the Series X controller, by not adding a similar feature. However, the controller feels lighter than the last, that could be due to the fact I am using batteries instead of a play and charge kit. It feels also, slightly slimmer all around, but the shape is still ergonomically pleasing for any hand to hold. I don't mind the absence of an internal battery pack. I find that the play and charge is a nice option, and that with batteries you never have to worry about being plugged in. The jump to USB type C is nice as well, as most of the devices I own use that port exclusively. Added on to the controller's body is a texture around the back of the hand grips and the tops of the triggers. My grip feels more stable and connected. Also, the addition of a share button is nice for two reasons. First it is a great way to capture what you want without sacrificing gameplay or being vulnerable in a multiplayer title. And 2, it allows for screenshots to now be captured that when being taken by hitting the Guide button, would sometimes cause elements to disappear.As for the value tucked away that I mentioned, that comes thanks to Game Pass. A service I was not fully sold on when it was announced, but as time went on, I became interested and am now a member. And now with them (Microsoft) partnering with EA to bring EA Access to game pass, it makes me wonder what the future holds.",1,english
Jesse W.,5,It's a great console,the United States ,20201116,True,"  I noticed the two reviews for this console are people that were upset that they didn't get one. Hopefully Amazon will remove these. I have purchased the Series X, and am very happy with what I got. The loading times are great, the games look and play great, and the console is super quiet. If you have Game Pass, you can't go wrong with this purchase, and if you don't, you should get Game Pass. It really is a great console, and I can't wait to see what games will be coming out for it in the future.",1,english

Jay Gonzalez,5,"""Xbox and Microsoft did an amazing job with this console in every way."" 10 out of 10",the United States ,20201117,True,"  It is an amazing console... I find it ridiculous how some of the negative reviews are based on no exclusives at launch. Like didn't they know that before pre ordering?The fact that I still haven't played many titles due to my busy life, there are so may games I can play off the bat on day one with this console. The fact that every game I played on the Series X runs so fast with loading time, and higher and steadier frame rates impresses me. Definitely a great upgrade from my Xbox One X to the Series X.I was able to simply use the 2 hard drives I had on the One X to the Series X with no problem, but if I want to play a game where I would want the Series X to take advantage of speed and performance, I would have it in the Series X's Internal drive, or in the SSD Seagate 1TB that goes behind the console.$500 for what it includes on the specs alone is a heck of a deal.5/5 No doubt. Xbox and Microsoft did an amazing job witwith this console in every way.",0,english
Ron O.,5,"Older games look great, running 4k at 60fps",the United States ,20201111,True,"  Set up was a pain with a Gmail account for my Xbox account..but after that everything is great! 1tb fills up fast though! Forza Horizon 4 looks great, but can't wait to see cyberpunk on this!! The green showing from the top is just colored plastic, not a light (which I was concerned about)",2,english
MrSavoie2U,4,Best Xbox console to date however...,the United States ,20201212,True,"  This is above and beyond the best Xbox console to date, however there are system updates still needed to improve the overall performance in games. Due to the fact that Microsoft waited for AMD to finalize the RDNA 2 feature set so the Series consoles could have the entire feature set, the system is behind in terms of max performance capabilities. Once these system updates roll out and the system fully utilizes the full RDNA 2 feature set and games are taking full advantage of them, we should see the full potential of the console. Early on there seems to be some slight performance issues with the cross gen titles at least. Still very happy with Xbox and the direction it's going as a gaming platform.",0,english
Jesse,5,Xbox Series X is amazing!,the United States ,20201114,True,  Xbox Series X is everything I hope and dreamed it would be! The first game I played on it was Assassin's Creed:Valhalla! It looks absolutely amazing! 4k resolution at 60 frames per second! Load times are extremely quick thanks to the custom SSD Harddrive. The new Controller is pretty awesome too. It has new grips on the back of the controller and also on the triggers. There is also a new share button on it that allows you to take screenshots of the games you are playing. If you hold the button down it records a game clip. Xbox Game Pass Ultimate is really awesome with Xbox Series X. Xbox Game Pass Ultimate now includes EA play at no additional cost. EA Play contains over 70 games. I highly recommend getting an Xbox Series X if you want to experience true next gen gaming!,1,english
Berty Martinez,4,Next gen gaming,the United States ,20201202,True,"  Have had it for 2 weeks now. Gotta say that it's a pretty cool console. If you have an XONE or OneX you'll feel familiar with the ui since it's basically the same. Now there aren't that many games that scream Next gen yet. Though the upgrades for series x/s optimized games are very cool with more incoming. As it stands, besides things like quick resume(which has it's few issues like not working 100% of the time), faster loading times, this gen is barely starting. So don't fret if you haven't been able to get one yet. Another point with these new consoles (ps5 included) is that in order to play at 4k 120 frames per second you need a tv that has hdmi 2.1. I went with an LG un 65nano85una. Awesome tv and not as pricey as oleds.",1,english
Destiny martinez,3,...,the United States ,20201120,True,"  Super excited after waiting, I finally got it today! Maybe 2 to 3 hours of play it shut off on me completely with no warning! I was in the middle of a call of duty game and it just gave out! I turn it on again and sure enough it shut off on me an hour into my game play!",3,english
HiTechKoolAid,5,Loading times were worth the upgrade.,the United States ,20201126,True,"  I know most people will say there is no reason to upgrade at this time due to no exclusive content, but the loading times alone were worth it.  Borderlands 3 loading times are like 4 times faster.  Game loads in around 1 minute compared to 5 and fast travels are around 13 seconds compared to 1 minute.  Think of how much time people wasted farming on the Xbox One due to those horrendous loading times.  As they say ""Time is Money"" and this system will definitely save you time so you can do other things instead of wasting it on loading screens.",1,english
james,3,Crashes when Playing,the United States ,20201128,True,"  I bought this console for the next gens games but every time I try to play a next gen game my console turns off after 30 mins of playing. This only happens to next gen games. I paid good money for this Console and I expected great things, come on Microsoft smh. The game runs smoothly before the console turns off. Everything else works really good no overheating or anything.",3,english
kdont,5,"Great system, good build quality, fast load times",the United States ,20201125,True,"  Great Xbox and a seemingly good upgrade from the Xbox One. Build quality seems nice and durable. The footprint of the device is much different than the older versions, to be standing vertically instead of horizontally.Load times are blazing fast. I've been playing Gears Tactics on game pass lately and the load times are dropped by more than half. Don't know if I've tapped into the usefulness of my HDMI 2.1 TV but games look excellent on my Sony X90CH 65"" TV.Overall a worthy upgrade from the previous gen. I'm pretty excited to see how long this device will last me",0,english
Vinod,5,Amazing System,the United States ,20201116,True,"  I've never been so blown away by a console before, this system truly delivers on what Microsoft promised. Although there aren't many games that can truly take advantage of the hardware performance the series x offers, the games that are x/s enhanced are otherworldly. Silky smooth 4k HDR at 120fps is gorgeous and I'll never go back. And it's soooooo quiet! Quick resume and transfer speeds from/to the seagate drive are a game changer. I transferred 100 Gb in 3 minutes. Crazy! I'm so happy with this console and can't wait for the next generation of gaming!",2,english
jpot,4,Great so far,the United States ,20201207,True,  Exclusives aren’t there yet but the game pass ultimate subscription is a great value as had different games to try out.  Loading is a lot quicker too.My only complaint would be the guide is exactly the same and the controller feels identical which sucks as it doesn’t feel like a next gen but a refresh.  Wish they would have revamped both like sony did,1,english
Andrew,5,Incredible value for what you get,the United States ,20201119,True,"  I am a PC gamer but when the Series X was announced I was going to pre-order.Console is great, well made and looks cool.Gameplay is honestly amazing at 4K. Some games run just as well if not better than my gaming rig PC, and I have a pretty solid PC.The controller is great and improved over an already really good controller design. The reach is much further than the gen 2 Xbox one controllers and the share button is great.I highly recommend this system to anyone. Having Gamepass ultimate with EA games included is an unreal value.",0,english
Kolby,5,Sexy Gaming Console!,the United States ,20210127,True,"  I've had this console for 3 months now and it is awesome. I can load large games like Forza Horizon 4 and Vahalla in 5-7 seconds. Plus, the quick resume is crazy impressive. For example, I started Halo MCC after 2 WEEKS of not playing it and it picked up in a campaign mission right where I left off!!! The console is very quiet. Graphics are super sexy, I highly recommend getting a TV that can take advantage of the 4K at 120fps. The new controller is comfortable with a better texture grip and d-pad. Overall, this is the best gaming console ever built. The Microsoft UI is streamlined and super user friendly as well.",0,english
LJ,4,A minor improvement over the Xbox One X,the United States ,20201204,True,  Xbox has finally perfected building a great console now it needs to work on getting some games out for that great console. If you have an xbox one x I would highly recommend waiting until they start releasing more games as there just isnt enough to play for next gen games that justify paying $500+. No complaints with the hardware though.,1,english
danny james franco,5,Excellent!,the United States ,20210118,True,  So I upgraded from the XBOX one X and I wasn't expecting much from the series X when I got but I was proven wrong. Games look waayy better especially with some games getting Auto HDR. Games also load faster when you transfer them to the internal drive same speeds fast of you use the series X expansion card. The main menu is still the same just more snappier same applies to the xbox store so that's good. Quick resume was a feature I was like ehh sounds good but whatever and I actually use it quiet often then I thought I would. My down side to it is that their isn't any new xbox game yet. If you have an OG xbox upgrade to this when you can and you will be amazed.,0,english
J,1,Unit won't power on after a month of use MS refuses to fix it,the United States ,20210107,True,  System just bricked itself after a month of light use.  It won't even power on and Microsoft refuses to fix it.  I'm betting Sony does not treat their customers this way.,2,english
pitchaj,5,Xbox is the best box,the United States ,20201115,True,"  Xbox series x is the real deal. Fast load times. 60 frames per second on games like assassin's creed valhalla. The new controller is really nice, a bigger improvement than people think. Tons of games to play on gamepass. Setting it up is seamless. The series x console runs whisper quiet. Next generation is here and xbox is better than ever.",1,english
Constance,5,Simply awesome,the United States ,20201119,True,"  Got this as a gift for myself.  Jumped on the pre order when it was first offered.  Love it so far.Awesome piece of tech.  Fantastic looking game system.  Comes packaged in a luxurious box.  The unboxing was amazing.So far the system runs fantastic.  Its so silent, you can't tell its on.  I've played a ton of older games and the backwards compatibility is second to none.  I've also played a few new games and they look and run very solid.Now we just need more games!",0,english
james landess,2,From Xbox One to next gen?,the United States ,20201116,True,"  Loads faster and looks a tiny bit better. Next Gen? Not at this point. My review remains the same almost 2 months later. You're buying an upgraded Xbox One! Thanks for the ""Next Generation Console"".",3,english
Boujee B,5,"Fast loading times, smooth gameplay, snappy menus make this the best console to date",the United States ,20201110,True,"  Exceptional hardware. Loading times and smoother gameplay/graphics are the winners here. Same UI you're used to and snappy menus. Quick Resume is a great and old games look better than before. Game pass is the killer app so far. If microsoft can bring the exclusives in 2021, it's a home run for Xbox.",1,english
Schyler Bisson,5,"The product is the most powerful, and very fast.",the United States ,20201111,True,"  The product is top notch. I am able to use all my Xbox One accessories on it. The load times are very fast. The system itself is very quiet. The step up from my previous Xbox is amazing. I highly recommend this product. The quality is amazing with 4K up to 120FPS (my tv is capped at 4K and 60 FPS, until I buy a 120hz tv/monitor). In person the console looks very sleek as well. I could go on for a while, it is everything you want in a console and more.",2,english
Amazon Customer,5,Next Gen is in.,the United States ,20201206,True,  Preordered September 22nd. Received package on launch day.This console is amazing. You’ve never experienced load times as fast as the Series X on any other console. The 4K HDR at 120hz is insane.The games can only get better from here. I’ve had no problem with my Xbox and highly praise it.Don’t buy from the scalpers. Be patient. Buy it at MSRP.,2,english
Dr.P,5,"Fast, no bugs, works well",the United States ,20201210,True,"  Very fast loading times, excellent graphics, no software bugs that I can tell, which along with the fantastic value of Gamepass Ultimate is what sets it apart from the PS5 for me. The PS5 crashes sometimes and the new PS5 menu isn't as good as the old one. In contrast, the Xbox menu is unchanged overall and just works well. It's auto-resume feature is fantastic. It is also completely silent. I put decals on mine to give the black brick a little personality.",0,english
Dustin Raphael,4,A day late and a screw loose,the United States ,20201112,True,"  I was supposed to get this on launch day but for some reason it stayed around in Georgia for 24 hours. I got it on the 11 and I noticed that a screw was loose. Not a little screw either but a big one. Doesn't even seem like the kind of screw that would even be used in the console. I wedged it into a corner because I didn't have any tools on me that could pull it out and then I tried the system out to see if it would run. I had it running for over 7 hours with no issues.  I have something that can pull the screw out at work and I will bring that to home with me to remove the screw. I saw a few reports of the screws falling out of other people's series x but the screws I've seen don't look like the one I have. Just wanted to mention this incase Microsoft, Amazon, or a potential customer is looking at reviews. I'm going to keep the system but if it dies on me after the return window closes I will forever curse the name Microsoft and the year 2020.",0,english
Kenny,5,Huge jump from last generation. Do not listen to negative reviews (trolls/fanboys),the United States ,20201113,True,"  Let me tell you the graphics, colors and FPS is greatly noticeable. I came from a PS4 and could not get a PS5. Anyone who writes a review that says it is not a huge jump must be a fanboy for PS or has a high end PC. This console is amazing at playing backwards compatible games and the FPS is highly noticeable. Every game looks stunning in 4k and the colors pop out more than before. If you have an Xbox one you will love this console. If you are like me you may need to buy new games in a different environment. Do not hate on any console, only buy what you want and not the opposite of what is being hated on.",0,english
Altoh khadka,5,AMAZON is the best,the United States ,20210125,True,"  I been hunting for these xbox for almost 4 months now . Sleepless night , countless try , countless store visits , filled .

Would recommend this to anyone ......",1,english
Amazon Customer,4,Beautiful Console,the United States ,20201209,True,  The thing I love most about it is the design. It did an amazing job compared to the PS5. Not to mention it's better sized. It is so architectural and minimalist. Mad brutalism/Kaaba vibes. The controller could have been designed better tho. Still has the primary colored buttons which takes away from the black-on-black aesthetic.,1,english
Kindle Customer,5,"Fast, faster. Speed of light.",the United States ,20201220,True,"  I lucked out and saw an article on the web that Amazon had a limited number of Xbox x Series. I went to Amazon and wow, it was still not sold out. It did about an hour later when I checked. So I lucked out. But the machine is amazing. That is not hyperbole. Borderlands 3 took close to 4-5 minutes opening on my Xbox One X. This machine takes about 10 seconds! from opening the game to playing. The games themselves run as smooth as butter no lag and stuttering on multiplayer games. Love it.",0,english
SGT_GAMER,5,What an upgrade to gaming in 2020!,the United States ,20201127,True,  The most powerful console just got upgraded again to the new most powerful console in my house thanks to this beast of a tower of power. It starts up so quick and older games work even better right out of the box with no updates needed. The Quick Resume feature is probably the most ground breaking thing in gaming not being talked about to this point. It will be even bigger of a story next year and thereafter!,0,english
Jason ,4,This was a more than interesting experience,the United States ,20201214,True,"  This is not necessarily Amazon's fault but this was the absolute worst ordering experience of all time... This whole experience was a whole lot of ups and downs but I finally got it and it's supposed to come in today... when I finally got it, I felt as if I was charlie getting the golden ticket in charlie and the chocolate factory. In total, I will make an update when my child opens the present for Christmas and if everything is in good condition. Thank you to everyone for believing in me and I hope you can get your hands on one too.UPDATE: It is now SUPPOSEDLY running late but it says it was shipped to a facility that is about an hour away from me... I will give another update tomorrow.UPDATE: I FINALLY RECEIVED THE CONSOLE AND IT LOOKS STUNNING IN THE BOX...",0,english

Chris Rodriguez,5,Best most powerful console,the United States ,20201110,True,  This Xbox Series X is a POWERHOUSE. It easily handles games in 4K while holding steady frame rates.,3,english
Ridge  Tawdrous,4,Amazing for an Xbox but has some minor kinks to fix,the United States ,20201114,True,"  I liked that this came on time, unlike another order I had from Amazon. It was an early Christmas gift for a friend and he honestly loved it, the resolution is really high and you can tell there was a nice amount of work done and considering I have the Xbox one s, I can especially tell the difference. However, I do not like the shape nor the price, for a 560 price tag you would expect something extra like a second controller or, who knows a headset or something, but nothing. The packaging was kinda nifty tho where it wasn’t a traditional Xbox box. I also did not like the way it was super vertical so I can’t really find a good spot to fit it now without blocking the screen or put it on the floor and hope no one topples it’s over :/",0,english
Beard,5,Best Xbox Yet,the United States ,20201212,True,"  Best xbox yet. Ignore the haters who can't get one. Everything loads insanely fast and the quick resume feature is amazing. Games just waiting in the background to resume. No wait times after it's loaded. Saves so much time and that's something you have less and less of as you get older and have kids. If you can find one, buy it!",0,english
James,1,Defective Controller,the United States ,20201127,True,  The xbox series x is a great system but my controller is defective when plugged into a headset my xbox friends say it creates a static sound.

Nate,5,"Familiar, yet next-gen.",the United States ,20201111,True,"  From the get-go, this console is easy to setup, think setting up a new iPhone.

Sophie ,5,Good,the United States ,20201126,True,"  I like it so far it works really well with my 4K tv a bought, once I compared the graphics to my Xbox one to this...I definitely see a big difference.

Kevin S.,5,plenty next gen enough for me,the United States ,20201115,True,  While people are right to point out that there arent a ton of next gen games yet already this thing feels so much faster than the ps4 i had and that was a great console.  Also yes this thing is a utilitarian brick but its smaller than you think it is (compared to ps5 especially) and blends in nicely with your existing entertainment setup.,0,english

Joksan Perez,5,Buy it as soon as you can!,the United States ,20201112,True,  This console is amazing. The controller feels similar but much better because of the small changes they made to it. Loading times and graphics are just as good as the Xbox advertisements said.,1,english

Just as expected!,the United States ,20201113,True,"  Just as advertised, high speed, great video quality, beware you’ll need a 4K TV to truly enjoy this feature, and if the TV or monitor is 120hz even better.

Jason G,4,Some great next gen features,the United States ,20210127,True,  I pre-ordered the series x and it was delivered to me a few days after release. The delivery itself was good.

I don’t like how the used the same old last gen display interface but that’s okay, I have the ps5 as well and the quality on the Xbox is a lot better! Especially when u play call of duty warzone online, huge difference in input lag because the Xbox provides a easier backward compatibility updater  because of its design. The Ps5 on the other hand struggles with updating backward compatibile games. They either have input lags or are chopping at times. Xbox truly shows it’s power! 5 out of 5",0,english
J. Merrill,5,Most Powerful Console Ever is right!!,the United States ,20201112,True,  Loving my Series X! I love how quick load times are for games and being able to switch between multiple games.

Michael A,5,Console to get,the United States ,20201121,True,  It's everything that I expected..with the game pass it's the console to get..may not have any new 1st party titles at launch but with the game pass and alot of the games like gears 5 and forza horizon 4 getting 4k upgrades then it's absolutely worth the buy. The series X is also extremely quiet...all that power in a little box that sounds that quiet is hard to believe but xbox did it..microsoft definitely did everything right this generation.,0,english
niuvis,5,"Great console, suggest to anyone that has an Xbox one s or less.",the United States ,20201113,True,"  This consoles amazing, straight up beast runs games at 60 fps at 4k most of the time. There are still not games enchanted for this but even then HDR comes in and makes them look beautiful either way. The heat on the console is not as bad as I thought it is when you put your hand on it but thats fine. I'm proud with this product and Amazon got it on time. Now let me tell you that if you have an Xbox one x I would wait a while, even though this is a beast it does not come with any exclusively so if your just wanting it for something new don't expect to be blown away.",0,english

The graphics are awesome, it’s quiet, it runs cooler than its predecessor, and load times are a fraction of what they used to me. I might be in love with a gaming console.",1,english
Ismatu Koroma,5,Better than PS5,the United States ,20201219,True,"  Fortunate for me I have both the playstation 5 and the xbox, and I can say I prefer the xbox over the playstation.

Sam,5,Best console ever.,the United States ,20201218,True,"  I love it, never going back to Playstation. I have only ever owned Nintendo and Sony until this generation, but I have had it with Sony's BS. I was lucky enough to get a Series X pre order and I could not be happier.

Some games that had slow downs (such as COD MW) are completely smooth on here. I also really like the controller, because, even compared to the Elite Series 2, the thumbsticks are better.

Insert name Here!,1,Scalpers ruined Xmas,the United States ,20210104,False,  My nephew Anthony who came to live with me in  2020 never had much let alone a modern game system. All year long talked about wanting the new Xbox. He saved up he collected cans from the neighbors all year and then when it was time to go buy one NOPE. All the bad men as he called them made it so a  13 yr old boy who worked his but off couldn't make his dream happen.For those who don't know we have some people who wrote software and they use it too buy up every console they can. Amazon and Walmart and game stop could put protections in place to stop mass buying but why they make their money and in the case of Amazon they make more when that item is bought then marked up.This kid is seriously devastated he at 13 cant understand why he saved all year and cant own a new game system.,4,english
Amazon Customer,5,Blows Away The PS5,the United States ,20210119,False,"  Why you may ask, well basically the only reason I've ever owned a Playstation, which I do like a lot is for it's amazing exclusives. No one can argue with it having the best! That being said the PS5 is nothing more than a glorified PS4 Pro, which i own and I'll keep until they don't support it anymore. Speaking of Pros here are the Pros and Cons of the Xbox Series, vs the PS5 and why it's much better imo.Pros.12 Teraflops as opposed to 10 tf in the PS5, many think this doesn't make a difference but for overall bandwith and graphical abilities it does make a difference.Game Pass is just a no brainer, along with my near 300 digital game collection I get over 100 that are free, with a small subscription which blows PS Now out of the water, because it's mostly all streaming (games) anyway.The graphical differences on PS4 exclusives using backwards compatibility on the PS5 is pathetic compared to the Xbox Series X. The XSX uses better texture filtering, 16x antiostropic filtering on ALL games, including enhancements from the Xbox One X (which is still a great console). So games look better, more colorful and the enhanced games just look out of this world. I tried many on the PS5 I had for a short time and could barely tell any differences. Also it uses Ps4 Pro code for all of it's games. In that case not raising the resolution at ALL on many titles. Which most had hoped for.You get 3 generations of backwards compatibility on the Series X, which I thought might not be that great and I would want new games, but it's a blast just to test them out to see how much better they look and play. Until Next gen only games arrive. Also speaking of which. The new Sony Exclusives (about 90%) will be on the PS4/Pro as well as Ps5. So what's the point?So overall the XSX just feels more premium, and looks a lot better. The PS5 is this hideous looking abomination that looks like some new building they just built in Dubai. It would be okay as a decorative piece like a vase or something. But I literally couldn't even stand to look at it sitting with my other consoles. It was immense. No I don't hate playstation but the Ps5 is by far the worst console I think they've ever made. And this could possibly be the best console Xbox/Microsoft ever make. And possibly the last, from what rumors say. So do yourself a favor, don't listen to the hype for PS5, and at this point don't bother. Wait a few years.Also with the XSX, just like the Xbox One, you can hook up ANY size external HDD to store games (an SSD external is needed to play the enhanced games) but that's no big deal Since the transfer from Ex to SSD is very very fast. With PS5 there are all sorts of issues with storage messing up, not working at all, rebuilding the database etc. Also I think the max is an 8tb hdd, also you can't use it for Media, MKV's, AVI's and such nearly as much as you can on the XSX. Which I also use for Netflix, Primes, Pluto TV, listening to MP3's and downloaded movie files etc.A couple things I don't like about the Series X, which are very few, is that the controller feels very cheap. The buttons smash in to easily, and it feels as if it could break after long periods of play. I really like the 360 controller (best ever made) and the original Xbox One controller. Which is compatible with the XSX, so if something goes wrong you can always use an old one. And sometimes it does have trouble syncing up right form the start, but that's easily rectified by hitting the button on the console.Lastly the console is whisper quiet, no issues to speak of. The PS5 I had, did seem a little quirky but not really bad, but I think more people have problems with it, and it does run much hotter. And I noticed the XSX SSD is slightly faster than the PS5's, which i found strange, but awesome at the same time. So I think this time MS may get back the crown they lost after the flop of the XB1. Which they deserve because the 360 was hands down the best console they ever had. Now it looks like the XSX is on it's way up. Maybe even the Series S will help, but imo get this, it's powerful, quiet, nice to look at and will definitely stand the test of time. Very future proof indeed. ENJOY!",1,english
BillH,1,It's worth waiting an letting the beta testers fight over it,the United States ,20201230,False,"  Look bottom line is if you already have an Xbox One X,,,wait. Save your money keep it in your pocket use that money to buy games but you can still play on X1X.. right now you're not going to get any better graphics the best you might get is some frame rates and some load times. If that's really worth another $500 or more plus all the hassle of stock to you then I feel kind of sorry for you. By the time games are actual next-gen capable within a year to two years after that a mid gen console that's more powerful come out.. day one edition consoles are for the beta testers. Then the Alphas come in and get the better deals the better product with the better content.. same with the PlayStation. Since I only use PlayStation for exclusives there's no reason for me to get one for at least a year...",2,english
Zack Campbell,1,This is not the next-gen console you're looking for.,the United States ,20210106,False,"  Having both a PS5 and an Xbox Series X -- I can safely say the PS5 is the real next-gen experience.Both have great base hardware, but the PS5 makes a real leap into the next generation with the groundbreaking DualSense controller, amazing 3D Audio, and a whole new UI -- While Xbox Series X is just a hardware boost to the pre-existing Xbox One. What a disappointment.And that's to say nothing of the massive games deficit between the two, which will only keep growing -- Sony has many of the world's finest studios churning out unparalleled experiences.I just can't find a reason to turn on my Xbox Series X at all right now. I imagine I'll find some reason eventually, but I have a strong feeling it's never going to justify the $500 price tag -- nor even a $300 one.I know the PS5 is hard to find right now, but keep trying. It's worth it.",2,english

R.C. Davidson,5,A Great System (for $500),the United States ,20210124,False,"  Before I begin, while I find the Xbox Series X easier to buy than the PS5, it is no stranger to being scalped like it's Sony and Nintendo counterparts.  If you are having a hard time getting this system, please be patient and don't pay scalper prices on eBay and Amazon.Now, to start off this review, I wouldn't fight said scalpers for one reason, games.  As of now, most games coming to the system haven't had release dates yet, as far as I know, and I don't think the studios Microsoft have bought have released any details on games for the system.  However, if you're a long time Xbox player, I do think things like Game Pass and backwards compatibility offer pretty decent value for the system.  With Game Pass, it's already a great value with around a hundred games to play (and Xbox Live Gold is included), and the system is also compatible with four generations of games (with some Xbox One games having upgrades).  While not every game is compatible, I find Microsoft's way of handling backwards compatibility better than Sony's PS5, which is only compatible with PS4 and PS5 games.  Only issue with the hardware/software side is the Xbox Live Gold requirement for online play.  If you're on Game Pass, you don't have to worry since it's included, but even if other systems are doing it, it's a paywall that needs to go away.  As of writing, consumers prevented the service from going up in price, and now Gold isn't required for free-to-play title no more (like how they're not required on other systems), but an online multiplayer subscription will never be a good value unless they use dedicated servers, and let's admit this, some games still use peer-to-peer (or console-to-console).I also like the hardware Microsoft was able to create.  While people could say that the system is big, I can say as a person who built an ITX PC, I would've loved to have a case this small.  It's a sleek box that's just barely taller than two GameCubes that also ran pretty cool and quiet.  While the SSD is half the speed of the PS5's on paper, I found that the games still load rather quickly.  The one trick Xbox has vs PS5's speed is Quick Resume, which allows your games to pick up right from where you left off.  This works great when you're playing a game like Crash Bandicoot 4 and a friend invites you to a quick game online.  Just switch to that game, and when you're done, switch back, and it'll be like you never left the game.Next is the new controller, and while it isn't a massive departure from previous controllers, it's the best one Microsoft has produced.  First, let me say that if you don't like the new controller (some people do say it is a smaller than the One controller), the Xbox One controllers work just fine with the new system, which is actually pretty pro-consumer of them.  What I do like about this controller, however, is the new d-pad.  It is based off the Elite controllers, and your thumb can easily roll around on it.  The controller also has a nice textured back, which gives a bit more grip.  The only issues I have are that it's still the same Xbox controller from the Xbox One, more or less.  There is still no gyro control (which I think it needs since gyro is the closest thing consoles like PlayStation and Switch have to mouse controls) or anything like the DualSense's adaptive triggers, and why in the 2020s does a controller still use AA batteries?  I know people have strange opinions and that I can buy rechargeable batteries for the controller, which I have received as Christmas presents, but even a $50 Switch Pro alternative controller, 8BitDo's SN30 Pro+, still has gyro and a removable, rechargeable battery, but Microsoft charges $60-65 for a controller that uses AA batteries.  Don't get me wrong, it's still a fine controller, great even, but Microsoft needs to catch up with everyone else, because before long, their controllers will start to feel outdated.Overall, I think that the Xbox Series X is a great system with even greater potential.  If Microsoft can utilize the",0,english
Ryan M,5,Amazing! Best Console yet,the United States ,20201216,False,"  Amazing.  I held out on the One X because there had been whispers of this next gen console for several years, so I figured I would just go all in whenever it came out.  I was one of the fortunate few who were able to snag a pre order, and I have been playing daily since launch.  The performance is unbelievable.  There obviously isn't much in the way of Series X games yet, but I have been catching up on some Xbox One games I haven't played, notably Doom Eternal and Control so far.  If those are considered last gen games running on the Series X, I can't imagine how games could look or perform much better.  They look incredibly great, and load times are basically non-existent.  It's just a joy playing.Packaging and set up really feel top notch.  They went over the top with the packaging, it feels really nice opening.  Set up is very easy too, similar to setting up a google product.  You do it all through your phone, and it is very easy and painless.  I was worried when there were reports of it ""running hot like a furnace"" pre launch, but those reports are pretty laughable.  It doesn't get any hotter than any other console I've had, and it actually probably runs much cooler than my old OG Xbox 360 that bit the dust a while back.  The great thing that you wont notice as well, is that it is super quiet.  The only time I hear it is when its whirring whenever I power it on.The only minor negatives I have are that it is big, and IMO a little ugly.  However it is smaller and I think better looking than the PS5.  I have it set up horizontally on my entertainment center, and it doesn't look quite right.  Its obviously made to be set up vertically, but I don't know anyone who puts their consoles in a vertical position, and not to mention you can't really put it in an entertainment center that way.  But when you're playing, who cares how it looks?  The other thing is that quick resume is finicky.  It doesn't work ALL the time, but when it does it's amazing.  You can literally power on the console, and you're playing exactly where you left off last time in about 30 seconds.  I also wish there were an SPDIF out for my AV receiver.If you're a gamer and deciding between the Series X or the Series S, I think in the long run the Series X is absolutely a better bet.  The main thing that scared me off on the Series S is the memory, and the lack of a disc drive.  The cost of the expandable storage is exorbitantly expensive, and the 500GB will probably fill up fast on the Series S.  If you buy the S and the proprietary storage, you're already at the cost of the Series X.  However the 1 TB on the Series X is perfect.  I currently have 13 games, between One and 360 versions, with about 50% storage remaining.  However, I'm sure future games will take some more space.  Overall, I am overly happy with this, and has made my quarantine time actually enjoyable.  Just do not buy from resellers on ebay, as I am sure more are coming available very soon.",0,english

leah erickson,3,"Quality Hardware, Firmware needs some help",the United States ,20201209,False,"  The difference in game quality both graphically and responsiveness was night and day from my Xbox One. The console powers on and delivers me to the hone screen in less than 2 seconds, and boots games in a similar timeframe.One major issue Microsoft needs to address, but probably won't, is the fact that many gaming monitors aren't compatible with the xbox at 1440p 120hz. These monitors can run these specs over hdmi 2.0, but don't conform to the standard VESA timings, which is all Microsoft uses. This limits many high end gaming monitors to 1080p 120hz, or 1440p 60hz, which is unfortunate. If you plan to upgrade your tv or monitor, make sure you do considerable research into which model will actually work like it should with the Series X.",1,english

My Xbox One and TV are the only things in my house I don't do wireless, and I would strongly prefer the series X be wired as well.  Support has been absolutely no help whatsoever.",1,english

I considered the PS5 but I hardly used my Ps4 and most of the games form last generation were purchased on the Xbox ecosystem so this made alot more sense.

Bill Bixby,2,"I'm honestly disappointed, doesn't really feel next gen.",the United States ,20201221,False,"  My honest non biased critique on the xsx DiscussionHonestly this system has been very disappointing for me. I have been a gamer all of my life, and never been a fanboy of the big 3. I game to game, and mainly get all 3 systems each gen. This isn't for the people who can't counter my points in a constructive way, and will just lazily label me a troll or some garbage. I currently have every Microsoft system hooked up, minus my og xbox which is put away. I only bought it because I still wanted to play true crime nyc, mech assault, and Def Jam fight for NY. I am upgrading from an xbox one slim to the series x.Onto the critiques:The network adapter is worse than the xbox one slim one. I have tested this mutliple times. I have downloaded a game on my one slim and a game update(Haven 1.66gb) on the xsx, the one slim downloaded quicker.Also it random disconnects for no reason. Since I got my xsx on 12/15 I have ran the system by itself and no other system, and I have run it along with my slim(I have to do something else with all these huge updates and upgrades going on). Due to it randomly disconnecting, it would cause freezing and system issues. I go to play said games, long system freezes and crashes. Disconnect, then immediately reconnect and then retry to play the said game. Then be told of a huge update file 3 times back to back(glitching due to disconnection), then it finally starts updating and upgrading finally.The huge update and upgrades. OH MY GOD!!!!!!! I swear this was the first thing to almost make me ragequit all future Microsoft consoles, and to sell my xsx for a ps5. I copied over some games from my external hdd. Think I would just get a upgrade to xsx version and be done with it? Nope!!!!!! You have to update huge files , only to be told you need to upgrade with 55gb+ sized files(Destiny 2 upgrade was 70gbs) on top of that. I don't feel like I bought a game system but a non stop updating and upgrading system. Boy do I feel for the people with data caps and restrictions.External Harddrive issues. I am using a wd 4tb passport extrnal drive on my one slim & xsx, pretty good brand. I bought it a year ago. I have 415 games on it digitally when I plug it into my one slim, however when I plug it into my xsx I have 385 digitally on it. What happened to those other 30 games? I have restarted both systems and then tried the external harddrive on both multiple times. I am at a lost.Downloading is really bad. When I initially saw the slower speeds and longer download times, I took to google and discovered via youtube you can't have games opened while downloading or otherwise you get slower speeds. On my one slim, I could download a game, watch youtube, and run rewards or gamepass and still get good speeds. On the xsx, that isn't happening unless you want your downloads to crawl to a snail's pace. I don't see how this is next gen, and previous gen could do better. This basically nullifies any value quick resume has.Auto Hdr. Why not make it to where you can turn off the auto hdr in each game individually? Why must it be either off or on? Some games can look good with auto hdr, while others like scarygirl looks weird with auto hdr. I am forced to cut it off and not enjoy the games that will benefit from it, or leave it on and play great games that visually look bad or weird due to auto hdr. No middle ground or compromise.Visual difference. Having upgraded from an one slim & nice 4k uhd tv, I barely see any real difference visually. From 4k blu ray movies to games, I see no real difference. I was expecting to be blown away since I was constantly told native 4k was so much better than upscaled 4k. I have tested out movies and games on the xsx, nothing has made me say yes this is worth owning a $540 system over lol.In Closing: Even at the moment of writing this, I am using my one slim to do youtube while my xsx updates and upgrades(66.13gb for forza horizon 4) to avoid slow down. I paid $250-$275 out of pocket(the rest in rewards points) for this system and I am severely disappointed by it. My one slim can do almost everything the xsx can do, if not some things better. I am not impressed. I wish I had waited 2 years.",1,english

sambadshaw@gmail.com,5,,Canada ,20201112,True,  To start off with I see a lot of post that say this is a scam etc. To clear the air. There are people that can resell through amazon just be weary of who you're purchasing from. I purchased this directly from Microsoft throguh amazon at 599$ CAD. I did also have to purchase a tv for the full experience samsung Q70 hdmi 4 supports 2.1 hdmi and 4k. The Q80 &Q90 do support this also if you were wondering.The xbox does give calibration options for your TV.The walk through at the beginning is really key for the experience.Yes we were short handed because xbox delayed all their new game releases but system functionality wise SO FAR is great. I will Update this once I've played some games just to advise of my full experience.,74,english
TDot2020,5,,Canada ,20201112,True,  Incredible machine. Sets up in a flash. The App is key for easy set up. Feels so smooth. HDR is incredible for upscaling games. Nice to have 800gb and purchasable expandable memory now.Obvious drawback are games. We need more. BUT the upscaling with game pass and HDR allows you to rediscover old games which is awesome.Playing the Xbox Series X with the Elite 2 controller and Arctis SteelSeries 9X is a transcendent experience. Truly the Ferrari of gaming.And it’s not THAT big compared to a Day 1 Xbox One.,26,english
amrit,5,,Canada ,20201111,True,  Microsoft killed it this time around. Compete focus on the gamer. And gamepass is a steal,23,english
Donovan331,5,,Canada ,20201114,True,"  The Xbox Series X addresses the Xbox One X's weakest point: speed. It has a powerful CPU in addition to its monstrous GPU and has built-in SSD. You'll be impressed with the speed from the get-go. The initial setup was super fast and it even allows you to copy settings from the cloud that it backed up from your previous console.You'll be up and running in no time, and if you are a Gamepass subscriber, you'll have great games to play such as Gears Tactics & Tetris Connected. You'll have to be patient though as they download or as you apply the Series X optimization patches. While the delay of Halo Infinite's launch left a big hole in the launch lineup, it did not really bother me as I have more than enough launch games to play. Yakuza Like a Dragon is quite fun and looks fantastic on the console. Tetris Connected, while not a graphical showcase, manages to look quite cool and flashy, and  is incredibly addicting with numerous online and solo game modes.The backwards compatibility truly shines and it is a joy going back to some of your favorite titles that perform better now with the power of the Series X. Forza Horizon 4 and Gears 5 never looked so good at 4K-60fps. The new controller is not a big change, but since I use the Elite 2 anyways, that didn't bother me all too much. I quite like how the new controller feels and it seems they made some minor yet meaningful tweaks to it overall. The bumpers seem more responsive to me and the share button is a useful addition.Looking forward to seeing what's next for this powerful console and I am very impressed with the overall package so far.  Cheers",17,english
Red,5,,Canada ,20201116,True,"  Purchased straight from Amazon on release day. Was surprised to see that they had the Xbox in stock (had no intention of buying on release day due to my limited luck in these things). Pretty happy with my purchase.So far I've installed Call of Duty Cold War and the game looks really great on my 4K TV. I upgraded directly from the regular Xbox One 500gb so there's an enormous difference between that and the Series X. The Series X boots up instantly, there's practically no wait times for any loading screens, and best of all there is no lag for once. You could feel how outdated my regular Xbox One became.Yes there is basically no games out for the system right now. Yes the PS5 is cooler because they redesigned the controller and have some decent games out right now. That being said, I purchased this Xbox for Halo so I'm just waiting for that. Is the console worth $599? Depends if you're okay with spending the money. Otherwise just wait it out with your Xbox One X or PS4 Pro for now. Don't pay scalper money please (it's not worth like 1 grand lol)",10,english
Howie Love,5,,Canada ,20201113,True,  The Xbox series X is the gold standard for gaming.It loads games in seconds and boots up super fast. Playing a 4K is beautiful as long as you have the appropriate TV or display. And your media apps are all available to view and work as expected.The system is packaged very well from Microsoft and it is a pleasure to open and wield protected. Out of the box it comes with everything you need.Setup is easy and fast with the Xbox app for smart phones. You will be up and running in a few short minutes.The system runs cool and Quiet! It is a huge improvement from last generation. You will need to make sure your entertainment unit has enough room for proper airflow or place it beside or behind your TV.The only con so far is the power cable is a little on the short side but definitely not to small but a longer cable could add flexibility for placement considering it’s size.,11,english
MS,5,,Canada ,20201115,True,  True 4K Gaming Experience!Played COD Warzone at 120fps and it amazed me how powerful the console is.  The size of the XSX is also perfect. The huge fan is extremely quiet. I can barely hear anything even it is working at 100% loading. The only thing I don’t feel as good as my PlayStation 5 is the controller. The DualSense of PS5 brings the next gen gaming to a whole new level. Really really hope Microsoft will update the controller soon! Right now I will buy And play a cross platform game on PS5 if the game is using dualsense until XSX gets a real next gen controller.,1,english
Vijay Ramkissoon,4,,Canada ,20201130,True,"  Firstly, if you are unable to get your hands on a Series X, be patient and keep checking the online stock. When I got this system I was impressed by the small size and the overall design that keeps everything subtle and cool, looks are going to be subjective but I like the way the Series X looks. After upgrading from an Xbox One, I am thankful for a simple power cord and no brick, the included HDMI 2.1 cable, and the new controller is like the old one so usability is great.The SSD is obviously an issue and expanding the space with the proprietary expansion is quite expensive at the moment, luckily the Series X recognized my old 4TB hard drive with Xbox One games, and it was really easy from then on to manage my games. I have Series X/S enhanced titles on the internal SSD while everything else is playable from the external hard drive.The issue I have is that there are no real titles here that can sell this console, missing is the one or two console release games that really show off what this system can do and that's why ""next-gen"" isn't quite here yet. If you're planning on getting a Series X or S anyway, I highly recommend Xbox Gamepass because it has a lot of games and titles like Forza Horizon 4 that are enhanced for the Series X/S and look and play amazingly well.",0,english
Sagers,5,,Canada ,20201126,True,"  If you’ve owned any Xbox One since 2013, using this Xbox doesn’t require any new learning of a new OS, which some might find as an annoyance since we are used to brand new OS’s with the launch of a new console. Plugging in an external HDD from my last Xbox One comes with the immediate access to all my previously installed games, which makes using the console immediately, much easier. Using Xbox Series X enhanced patches requires that you either copy or re-install the game to the internal SSD or Seagate Expansion SSD (which I don’t have). I was a bit disappointed to see that game installing is still dramatically slower than my PC with similarly equipped specs, but it is still an upgrade over the Xbox One models. Playing Xbox Series X enhanced games with an HDR display look awesome. They are remarkably sharp and the colours look vivid with performance I could only previously achieve on my significantly more expensive custom built PC. For the retail price of $599 Canadian, I can say that as a PC Gamer, this console is well worth the price, especially when paired with Xbox Game Pass Ultimate (which I was surprised to see no code in the box for).",0,english
Mojomojo,2,,Canada ,20210130,True,"  This console release is even worse than the PS5 in the sense that it has even less future exclusives. They are trying to price this at a lower rate to compete, but the reality is that after 2 months, you can see that the PS5 is in much higher demand than the XSX. They are smarter about the material since they use matte black, which is way better than some cheap gloss black on the PS5. The issue is the design of this, it is literally a rectangular box. If there's somewhere that you can put it without needing to look at it on a daily basis, that is fine. Otherwise, it's a box sitting around.The performance of this is also not as great as the PS5, but it seems like every generation Microsoft is just a touch behind. Without a current list of exclusive released yet, you are better off staying with the older generation machines until more games come out or stick with a PC.",0,english
peter,4,,Canada ,20210108,True,"  feels like x1 x nothing new use same interface so its like still on x1 and games well its xbox they have no exclusives so basic 3rd party stuff all games can play on ps5 or pc , system resume feature is amazing and best new thing to gaming .  but if you want play games cheap they have gamepass ultimate . the extra memory is stupid its $350 Canadian after tax for 1 tb memory  and system only comes with 800 gigs usable space , so you will be deleting and re installing a lot when games like cod are 180 gigs .  bottom line i would wait for price drop since halo never released so all games are old x1 stuff or 3rd party.  plus so stupid no Bluetooth and speeds to dl are not great not sure part used for internet card but compared to ps5 its slow as hell downloading and install from disk .  controller is same nothing new but dpad style and still only company uses batteries wants us pay more for there charger something sony and Nintendo built in to there amazing controllers",0,english
Amazon Customer,5,,Canada ,20201122,True,"  Coming from an orginal 2013 Xbox One the Series X is an amazing upgrade.Games load in seconds, quick resume is a great feature allowing me to game surf like never before. 1 TB of space is a huge amount I currently have 15 games loaded the majority AAA.This has been the most affordable generation change ever, I didn't have to buy a 2nd controller as all my Xbox one devices are compatable. Gamepass is such a huge value allowing me to play brand new games like Gears Tactics and Tetris Connected and load up Series X upgraded games like Gears 5, Sea of Thieves, and Forza Horizon 4. I haven't had to spend anything on games and can wait until some of the launch lineup goes on sale.Playing game in 4k and especially 60 FPS is so nice. I feel so grateful to be one of the lucky ones to get this at launch. Thank you Amazon Canada for the flawless purchase and shipping. This has not been the case with a lot of retailers including your American counterpart. I'm so grateful.",1,english
Pinz,5,,Canada ,20201210,True,"  The ability to switch between games quickly is wonderful. Knowing MS they will keep tweaking and updating the UI over time. The loading times are so much better, even for older games. I used to wait over 30 seconds every time I fast travelled somewhere, and now it’s like 5 seconds or less.For most people the Series S will be fine, but if you sit close to your TV or really need that 4K resolution, then this is the way to go. Considering Series X has more storage, and the storage sticks are expensive, it’s better to pay more upfront now for the space AND get a better console. I think games will only increase in size, and being able to hold 5-10 compared to 10-20 is a big difference.",0,english
HomeDaddy,5,,Canada ,20201205,True,"  I had a real hard to securing an xbox series x, but thankfully I found it in stock on amazon! It was shipped quickly and I received it in a few days! Very happy with amazon's service and speediness.  The xbox is awesome, playing games in 4k 60fps is something I wanted since seeing it first hand. The difference between 30fps to 60fps is amazing and makes everything so much smoother. I can't wait to try out 120fps once I get a game that supports it!  No idea what that will be like!  The xbox is quiet, does not overheat and is a dream to play. This next gen upgrade is amazing! Can't wait to try out cyberpunk 2077 when it comes out next week!",0,english
Travis,5,,Canada ,20201113,True,  This console runs smooth as silk 4k ready  with extremely fast load times due to the on board SSD . This system requires a internet connection for initial setup. This console runs hot so have it in a well ventilated or open space. ( Mine smelt like burning plastic for about 3 hours seems fine now tho),2,english
joshua Zavitz,5,,Canada ,20201220,True,"  Runs cool, runs quiet, and it's a powerhouse for the value. Everything I expected and more. Running assassins creed valhalla 4k at 60fps locked is freaking cathartic. Load times are practically non existent, not having to wait between loading screens helps maintains immersion like I didn't expect.DO NOT BUY FROM SCALPERS, they are scum of the earth opportunists. Wait a couple months for the farse to end and grab one in store. Would be soooooo satisfying if all these jackasses ended up stuck with consoles they can't sell, that way it puts them in the hole.",1,english
Yash Srivastava,5,,Canada ,20201112,True,"  Such a great console. Great speed, graphics. Game Pass is a game changer, basically Netflix for games for only $1 a month. Couldn’t be happier to play all my multi platform games!",4,english
Wendel Fisher,5,,Canada ,20201113,True,"  This game console has 12 teraflops - that's almost 10 times as many teraflops as my previous game console (the Xbox One, which only had 1.4 teraflops). Needless to say, I won't be needing any additional teraflops for quite some time, as this game console more than satisfies my need for teraflops. Highly recommended if you are in need of 12 teraflops (or, 12 trillion flops).",1,english
JaEWoN,1,,Canada ,20201209,True,"  amazon used purolator and they did not come to my door but went straight to the pickup location which is 1 hour away by public transpiration. i left my cell number, buzz, didnt go out on the day of delivery but nothing happened. yet, amazon once again used purolator for my other order and it is being delayed for more than a week and i cancelled it.",2,english
Brendyn,5,,Canada ,20201220,True,"  Had to wait a couple days after launch for it even after ordering it on day one (September 22nd) but I didn’t mind as it was still the earliest I’ve ever bought a next gen console. I’ve been loving it so far and will only get better once next gen games actually come out in numbers.I have the PS5 as well and have to say, I’ve had significantly less early adopter glitches on the Xbox. Great work Microsoft !",0,english
Josue Rivera,5,,Canada ,20210105,True,"  If you are able to get your hands on the xbox it is a great system. very quick on every aspect although if you do not have a TV that can support it, you will not be able to experience the full range of the xbox. 4k at 120 fps is the optimal performance that the xbox can currently be used at. My tv has the ability for this although it does not have the proper HDMI port of 2.1. MY tv has 2.0 which can only support 4k at 60 fps or 2048 at 120 fps. so this is something to pay attention too!",0,english
Aaron Patterson,1,,Canada ,20201118,True,"  Spent 599 on a unit that arrived several days late. I got to play it for less than a week before I recieved this message. So far zero support from Microsoft. Tried to put in an online service call, Microsoft wanted to charge me for the repaired unit to be shipped back. Absolutely terrible customer service. Worked well when it worked.",1,english
Sang,5,,Canada ,20210103,True,"  Going from Xbox One S to the Series X is almost night and day. High refresh rate, Xbox one X enhanced games, quick resume, fast loading, and just better performance overall. Controller feels great and probably my favourite one so far, only thing that’s annoying is that the Y button isn’t super responsive, not sure if it’s a minor defect or all the controllers have it but that’s the only downside (it won’t ruin the gaming experience). Once these consoles get a restock, definitely try to snag this.",0,english
Miguel Angel Espinosa,5,,Canada ,20201111,True,"  Excellent, the shipment arrived faster than usual",4,english
Amazon Customer,4,,Canada ,20210107,True,"  I received this xbox and was blown away by the speed, but I couldn't play any Series X games on it as they kept crashing and shutting the console down, so I had to send it in for repair to Microsoft within first week of use.I did not have the previous Xbox one so this was a huge upgrade.Cons:No Games, but coming from the 360, I picked up a lot of games I missed from the Xbox One, which I thought were impressive to pass time until actual games for the Series X come out.",0,english
Ye Old Lazy Buyer,5,,Canada ,20201114,True,  I really enjoy using the new Xbox series X. It was easy to setup (requiring an app was interesting) and the 4K experience is brilliant.I do miss the one guide experience though. It just made things easy to go from IPTV box to Xbox one output without the projector having to switch inputs. Most people won’t miss it.The existing Xbox one content runs/loads faster and it is hard to go back onto the old Xbox one now.,0,english
Brodie Groch,1,,Canada ,20201123,True,  The box that came with the Xbox was completely destroyed. It looks like they were throwing it around all day. Very unimpressed.,2,english
bear,5,,Canada ,20201126,True,  I'm very happy with this buy! The shipping with Prime was extremely fast and I'm so glad I don't have to buy a new TV stand to make it fit nicely. I was worried it would be too tall and bulky to fit [it looked a lot like a desktop computer tower in photos and ads] but it fits perfectly on its side where my old Xbox One was. My Xbox One's processor used to struggle with certain games and apps but the Series X runs them beautifully. It indeed plays all my Xbox One games but I can't wait for the new ones to come out so I can experience the full system.,0,english
Jamie,4,,Canada ,20201121,True,"  Just love it but like everything have bought on amazon last 2 months 2 day shipping took over a week was mad as my self from trusting amazon with my preorder of a system, don't make same mistake as me when preordering video games and system there many places out there that ship on time and don't even charge you  $7.95  month from that service",0,english

Allie B,5,,Canada ,20201201,True,  No issues getting my new console through amazon. It was a bit delayed as I bought mine on launch day but only by a week. Great new console with amazing specs. The processing speed alone was worth the switch for me.,0,english

Amazon Customer,5,,Canada ,20201203,True,  Absolutely loving the Series X. Upgrading from a Xbox One S and the differences in graphics and performance are really noticeable. Games run really smooth and look a 100x better than previous gen. Quick resume is one of the best features where you can have multiple games open and swap between them without loading in.,0,english

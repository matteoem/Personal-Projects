Nobody Important,5.0 out of 5 stars,"A great all-in-one console,",the United States ,February 28 2018,Verified Purchase,"  I really love my new PS4 Slim, it's great, easy to setup and has a tons more options.Pros:Current Gen Console as of 2/28/2018Alot faster than the PS3 in generalTons of free gamesPlaystation Now is a pretty decent deal and has a wide selectionTons of media apps like netflix, hulu, amazon video, funimation, etc...Controller allows you to change brightness of glowTons of customization options to suit your console to you (including high contrast)Playstation plus seems to offer better deals for digital.Cons:No more composite output, which means I can't get audio through my pc the easy wayWhen you are downloading many items there can be menu lagSome apps tend to glitch and close application isn't an option. However, you can easily just restart.I got this because I had no reason to get the PS4 Pro, I don't have a 4K TV nor do I really care about 4K Gaming (and the 6-8 games that are supported for 4K on the Pro.) Honestly I just found this to be a better deal, as the Pro just seems to be a lazy cashgrab. It definitely is slim and fits into pretty much any keyboard space (for those of you with multiple desks like me.)Pretty much the ideal console in my opinion.",364 people found this helpful

There is a very noticeable performance between my slim and the original. The network connection on my slim is twice as good, games load much faster, download times are much quicker and most importantly I have twice as much HD space for games. I don’t even play a lot of games but still somehow ran out. If you’re noticing a decline in performance on your original ps4 you should definitely invest in a new with plus you can add on a 4 year warranty.",351 people found this helpful

chefhoeyardee,1.0 out of 5 stars,STOPPED WORKING FIRST FEW MINUTES,the United States ,February 22 2019,Verified Purchase,"  Seriously DO NOT BUY THIS. I was looking forward to this all week, even got a game and headset for it. I come home, hook it up, and it works just fine. I'm going through setting up my account and as I'm putting in my card info for PlayStation plus, it shuts off out of no where. I try to plug it into a different outlet, still doesn't work. I press the power button, nothing. When it does come on, it's on for no longer than a few minutes. I can hear a slight staticy sound when I move the power cord around. Sometimes it'll even shut off with a static screen on the TV as it shuts off. This isn't just a simple overheating problem, this is a defective console. I'm assuming the seller receives faulty consoles that other unhappy consumers have returned and just resells them for cheap instead of actually fixing them. RIDICULOUS. Now I have to wait over a week to get my money back and I MIGHT try to get a different console, but you can bet I'm staying FARRRR away from Amazon.

Erik,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Good Games, But..",the United States ,January 7 2019,Verified Purchase,"  I like the  PS and have always been a fan; the games are great, but that is a matter of opinion, so I'm giving the system 2 stars based on the system itself and my experience. I guess it goes without saying it hasn't been great. I had to replace my first PS because the infamous disc-eject issue. I tried everything but it just kept happening. My second PS is this slim edition. So far so good (hasn't broken), but compared to any system I've ever had (maybe beside the NES) it freezes the most, sometimes it just goes extremely slow in menus to the point you almost have to walk away before it's operational. It's also froze a few times without the power button being able to shut it off so you have to unplug, I assume, which has caused corrupted data, which has caused me to have to a reset. Literally the only other person I know with a PS, whom is a close Cousin of mine, has had to replace 2 systems already. We've ranted about how awful our experience has been with the PS4 on more than one occasion being that we've bought 5 systems between two people...for two people. I'm not saying anybody shouldn't buy one, more than likely yours will work, I'm sure, but I still feel the need to put in my 2 cents.",47 people found this helpful

Jonathan,3.0 out of 5 stars,Meh...,the United States ,December 24 2018,Verified Purchase,"  I wanted to discover what all the excitement about gaming and game consoles was about. Honestly, if you'e never done this sort of thing before, skip it. Reading a book, or going for a walk beat this type of entertainment easily. I can see how a child might be captivated by it; but not a fully functional adult.I spent about $200 on a variety of different types of games to see which one was right for me. Just figuring out how the controller works in most games is a deterrent. In any event, once you get the hang of that, ""gaming"" is a bit time consuming. At best, your mind becomes immersed in the game environment, and before long, you notice a few hours have passed. The entertainment value you gain for the hours of investment is mediocre at best. Go to a movie, it's cheaper and sticks with you longer.Now that I've got this thing, I'll continue to use it and explore more games. If I had it to do over again, I'd stay at a nice hotel for a weekend for the same money I spent on this device and be a bit happier for it.",40 people found this helpful

I bought it to share with my boyfriend and it's very easy to keep our different save files for our games separate. Both parties have access to the different games that have been downloaded even if only one bought the digital game. The only thing I would complain about is that we can't have two separate netflix log ins saved onto it. It has the one account preloaded all the time. The control are what you would expect and a little more. Sometimes, depending on the game, the controller will light up differently to show your health or in response to what a character is saying.

It's an amazing device and I really love it but one concern is that for some strange reason my controller disconnects every 5 minutes while maneuvering through my games library or even while gaming. This is really annoying and costs me dearly as it disconnects while playing, forcing me to push the little button behind to reset it every time. I know its the controller because even when I go to settings and change the connection from Bluetooth to USB cable it does the same thing. Shame my return window is closed, I'll just have to buy another controller, could have used that money to pre-order Spiderman but such is life I guess.

MamaOwl,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Wrong model received initially, but customer service was fantastic.",the United States ,January 31 2019,Verified Purchase,"  I was sent the wrong model; I received a 500GB instead of a 1TB like advertised. The PS4 works fine, came with everything. However, it was the wrong model. I contacted the seller and they were verylond and understanding on the mistake. I sent pictures for proof. I didn't want to return it because it was fine, worked, and I bought it to play a game on its release date the next day after it arrived. They were really sweet about listening to my concern about storage space and my disappointment on how I installed all my games and the storage was almost out (and it was literally 4 games) and that's why I bought a 1TB instead of a 500gb like I received - the storage space, as that was my only real concern. After speaking about how to resolve it, me mentioning I could get an external drive, I just didn't have the money at the moment because I spent all my funds on what I assumed would be a 1TB model and the new game I bought it for - they gave me a discount refund for 50$, so I could purchase an external hard drive for storage to make up for me not having a 1TB model. Customer service was great, I didn't have a problem other than being sent the wrong model for storage, which they helped me resolve with partial, small refund.  I was disappointed because of the storage issue, but with their help and understanding and customer support, I'm able to say I'm very content and happy with my purchase. :) If you ever get a wrong model or something is broken when you buy something, always contact your seller - theyight be able to help!

Serum,4.0 out of 5 stars,"A little harder to navigate than the PS3, but still worth it",the United States ,November 28 2019,Verified Purchase,"  This was a gift I received. I've been a PlayStation 3 user since late 2012, in fact, it was my first Blu-Ray player. I tend to get consoles at the end of their lifetimes, when all the bugs are worked out and all the good games for them have already been released. The PlayStation 4 is no different. I got the Slim model, with a 1TB hard drive. Back in December of 2012, I bought the ultra-Slim, 500GB model of the PS3. Seven years FROM now, I imagine I'll be doing something similar with the PlayStation 5. I've been a PlayStation user since Nintendo released the Wii, which I simply had no interest in playing and bought a slim PlayStation 2 at the time.  So now I'm a PS4 user and I've got to say, it's not quite what I expected but it's alright.PROS: It has an excellent selection of games, I don't play many titles, but I have five games for it, so far and they're all bought through the PlayStation Store. I've pretty much given up on physical copies because I've run out of room for more cases on my shelves, which are already covered in DVDs, Blu-Rays and books. The one terabyte hard drive simplifies this, as it'll probably awhile until I run out of room and need an external hard drive for this puppy. But I like the games I have, which are ""Always Sometimes Monsters,"" ""Stardew Valley,""  ""Catherine: Full Body,"" ""Persona 5"" and ""Death Stranding."" I still have plenty of room left on my hard drive and I think buying physical copies is just a tradition some people don't want to break.CONS: Clunky user interface. I'm still confused by where all my games and apps are. On the surface it seems like it's going to be even simpler than using the PlayStation 3's user interface, but it's actually quite confusing to navigate. At least I think it is. I go to my ""TV & Video"" folder and instead of having just the apps I have downloaded (Amazon Prime and Netflix) it shows me like, six other app ""suggestions"" (advertisements, really) that they think I should download and pay for those services when I have absolutely zero interest in them. I've been told there are ways around this, but I'm confused as to how to go about fixing it as I'm not the tech-savvy person I was ten years ago, anymore. But I'm still figuring this beast out.So in conclusion, it's a good system with good games, a good Blu-Ray player and a good amount of hard drive space for the price but it has a very clunky user interface that leaves me often times feeling bewildered. Like I said, I got this for free, so I'm not complaining, I have a lot of learning to do with it. One other thing I want to add is that the controller battery life seems a little short-lived for some reason. I don't know if that's just something I'm imagining or what, but it definitely doesn't seem to last as long as the PlayStation 3's controller. But all in all, it's a pretty good system and I like what I've gotten on it a lot so far so at least I have that going for me. I guess I'll give this one a solid four out five stars.",2 people found this helpful
chad JJ,2.0 out of 5 stars,gotta be honest about this system it's a mix bag for me,the United States ,July 9 2019,Verified Purchase,"  what i do like about this system is that every game is ultra realistic and in hd but that's when the Praise stops from me because the negatives are alot like one being a small library of games and every games from other generations from ps1 ps2 & ps3 are getting ported into this console to be in hd for remastered which kills the potential that this system did had well for me because the only thing ppl keep asking for is a remasters from other PlayStation systems how do u expect this to evolve? to me this is the ps vita of home consoles that barely offers any initiative games  oh the only way to Play online is to buy Ps plus which starts from 10+ to 60+ dollars which is backwards since ""PS3 COST NOTHING"" to play online and doesn't hassle to buy anything in order neither. what makes ps4 even wost is that in the modern age of gaming we're in the loot box era so not only that u be spending 60+ if u want the Ps plus which are monthly but u also have to play games of chance if u are a fan of nba2k, fifa, star wars, all of the battle royale games: Overwatch, Apex Legends, Fortnite and etc. even wwe 2k games has loot boxes it's sad i really missed thq at least they never Put out cash grabs unlike 2k.so my point is this if u want to pay 500, 400, &300 for this system including fee to play games  and a monthly required Ps plus just to play online with friends then this console is for u if u want to just enjoy games without any fee to play games and that doesn't require Ps Plus and have fun like what gaming used to be and supposed to be without having any greedy gaming publishers being in your wallet then i recommend buying a ps3 it may not be graphical but at least u can have fun and do not get pressured on spending like in the current era of gaming. so i give this a three in a half stars its great but too many others things in this era ruins it's Potential and it's way too much greed going on these days including Sony in current gen.",2 people found this helpful

Steven Cordero,5.0 out of 5 stars,Perfect Upgrade,the United States ,April 8 2019,Verified Purchase,"  Perfect upgrade for anyone looking to improve on their original PS4 without making the jump to the PS4 Pro.I bought the original PS4 for my son's 9th birthday and 5 years later it has gotten slower, louder and overheats quicker. The PS4 began freezing up recently and the eject mechanism stopped working. Rather than spending money on a repair, it became obvious that a new system was needed. The question was whether it should be the PS4 Slim or PS4 Pro.  I chose the Slim because it was an obvious upgrade over the original PS4, but far less than what I spent on the original system when it came out (I bought it not long after the launch). It's quieter, faster and doesn't overheat.  Plus, it was far cheaper than the PS4 Pro.  I also bought a new 2TB HD, which I installed, and the total price (PS4 Slim and 2TB HD) was less than what the PS4 Pro is currently going for.  Of course, the PS4 Pro has its advantages, but if you're a longtime PS4 user looking for an upgrade over your old system at the right price, you can't go wrong with the PS4 Slim.",3 people found this helpful

I went on Amazon, and found the first site selling PS4 units and the line ""Amazon's choice for PS4's""  So I thought that was a good sign so I went ahead and placed my order.  Long story short, the package came in a few days, and there was no damage and everything seemed to be accounted for.  The actual PS4 works well so far.  I have had it one month tomorrow the 14th.  A few days ago, and the main reason for 3 stars is, the controller stopped working out of the blue.  I went online and tried ever trouble shooting tip under the sun, but it seems as through it's a dud.  I went and bought a new controller and works fine, but all this lead me to wonder if I had gotten a used or refurbished model?  Everything looks and feels new, and it is probably just that the controller was defective from the factory.  I have read several reviews from people who said their PS4's have given up the ghost after a couple months.  Overall I am happy with the unit but the bum controller made me raise an eyebrow.  I am by no means whatsoever insinuating that this company did a bait and switch or mis-represented itself.  Flukes happen, so take this review for what it's worth.",3 people found this helpful

C.C.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great system,the United States ,October 22 2018,Verified Purchase,"  There's a lot of great games for the PS4 so this is a good buy. As a console it's decent, sort of sleek looking, and comes with a controller, AC cable, and HDMI cable. The 1TB storage is generous and seems like too much to ever fill up. You can play DVDs and BluRays too, and it will play European games in the USA just fine though some games will not have DLC available due to the region mismatch so be careful.I think the PS4 user interface is pretty garbage and the media sharing doesn't work as well as it does on the Switch, but beyond that it's a solid system.

It came as specified and was well packed, everything was wrapped in sealed plastic except the console itself, I don't know if they even still do that sort of thing so it is what it is. It had a great unused discount card with it. And strangely came with a disc of Uncharted right in the mouth of the console. Strange. It makes me wonder if I should better check the model because the description said nothing about that.

13-5,5.0 out of 5 stars,Sony is still at the top!,the United States ,December 29 2018,Verified Purchase,"  I may may have bought this console late in its life, but not so late as to miss the opportunity to appreciate the fourth console in the lineup. This is actually on par with the PlayStation 2 (keep in mind, this is just one person's opinion). I say this because the PS2 still has a place in my heart since its debut in 2000.I've always preferred the PlayStation over Microsoft's Xbox, since it has an amazing first-party library compared to its competitor: Uncharted, Yakuza, Horizon: Zero Dawn. The controller is another reason that I choose this over Xbox; it just feels more precise. (I apologize to anyone reading this who is a dedicated Xbox gamer. I'm not insulting it; rather, I'm just pointing out my preferences in a video game. I've played every generation of the Xbox and I like it, but my choice is elsewhere)I can't wait to play the remake of Resident Evil 2. I played the original back in the day on the first Playstation, so gaming on its descendant console will be like a time-honored tradition.Long story short, I love this console and I'm glad I saved my money to purchase it!",One person found this helpful

I feel like I’ve been screwed here, as the window to return has passed and if I want to continue investing, I need to buy a new machine.

J&J Z,5.0 out of 5 stars,A real solid system!!!,the United States ,February 28 2019,Verified Purchase,"  Never played with a PS4 before, last system purchased - XBOX360SO - with all the cards on the table - REVIEWComes ready to go, as is. 1 Controller standard with a chargin cable, a cheapy looking 1 ear mic/headset combo that actually works surprisingly well. If you already have a PS4 game, you are ready to play as long as it is not an online game. You have to create a PSN account and at least register a card to the account/system in order to do ANYTHING online. So if your getting this gift for a lucky kid, just know that they will be ON YOU for that info PDQ ... heads up.Outside of that, the hardware is fast. The system boots in under a min and balances the memory load as you play (you wont have the iPad problem of 100 apps open at once and the device performing like junk) It only allows 1 app and 1 game to be left running simultaneously - games look great and the online streaming ability is really cool",0 people found this helpful

But i hit the year and 2 month mark and i get this ""Blue light of death"" which does not allow me to turn on, or the instructions to put the device in ""Safe Mode"" to basically factory reset the device where i lose all data on the device. I have been an Xbox user for the past 10 years owning 2 Xbox 360s and 2 Xbox ones and not once did I have any issues with all 4 of those devices. I was willing to send the device into Playstation to get worked on and serviced, but during these times the workload is limited and they are not doing this work as of now (frustrating but i understand the circumstance and agree with playstation on this one) I just wish i could have had 2 years out of a $300 device from such a quality company.....

Scrambles,3.0 out of 5 stars,I feel like I made a poor decision,the United States ,May 21 2020,Verified Purchase,"  I don't like the price for a Playstation Plus account, it kind of makes interacting with other players in the world more of an obligation than a leisure thing. Then I lost a lot of over all interest in the product when I found out that I can't play the game I bought without the internet being connected witch means our game play is being monitored by people with a low IQ.

I've tried connecting to different wifi, deleting some apps, checking my ping, asking on yahoo answer, but it honestly just seems like whoever had it before me, if it was used, messed up the actual hardware for the internet connection (which ive done before too).

It was supposed to be here between Feb. 10 - 18, but I received it today (Jan. 23). That was fantastic. The only complaint I have is that the front right corner of the console is cracked and the right side doesn’t seem to be fully attached. Now that being said it was a refurbished previously owned. So I wasn’t expecting a brand new console. The crack can be fixed easily with some super glue but I was a bit disappointed. It was packaged really well and the box was undamaged. The rest of the wires and the remote work perfectly fine as well. This is my first day using it and I’ll be sure to update my review in about a week or two after really putting it through various test.

I used it sparingly at that point so I didn't even bother to seek a refund or replacement.Bought this one inside of 4 months ago because I was looking to occupy myself while at home. I only used it a few hours a week and it is suddenly not working.There is no support available from the manufacturer. The tech is total garbage and not worth the investment. If I could leave a zero star review, I would. Do not purchase. Do not bother with the PS5. Read a book instead.",0 people found this helpful
Lin,1.0 out of 5 stars,Hard drive failure immediately after regular usage,the United States ,August 7 2020,Verified Purchase,"  Worked well at first, but I only played a few games on it the first year I owned it. Since COVID-19, I used the PS4 weekly and the hard drive failed immediately with regular use. Horrible system for the price point. Will never buy via this seller again. Something seems off with this item given other similar reviews.

Arrived well packaged and super speedy delivery. This console is wonderful. Being new to PlayStation, I'm really impressed so far. I have played on x-boxes exclusively for years, I currently have an Xbox 360 and an Xbox one. For a long time there have been more and more games that I wanted to play that were only available on the PS platform. Don't know why I waited so long to get one, aside from not being rich. So far, this console is intuitive and easy to use. The controller fits my hand well and I think I prefer it over the bulkier Xbox controls. Navigating the system is easy and the downloads and overall play seems speedier and more seamless than I expected. I know some of this relies on your internet speeds, but I can compare this to what I'm used with my other console. I don't want to turn this into a console war as both systems have great features, but I already really love my new PlayStation. The graphics are great. I look forward playing all the games I've wanted to in the past, especially a lot of Japanese imports.Very pleased that I took the leap.",5 people found this helpful

David Lacayo,1.0 out of 5 stars,These controllers are damaged,the United States ,September 29 2018,Verified Purchase,  I ordered this Playstation bundle in February and had to order a second controller in April. It just decided to stop working. It was fully charged and it turned off and never turned on again. I took it to uBreakiFix and they diagnosed it irreparable. There is a 1-year warranty for this where you have to ship it to Texas (pay it yourself and costs around $25) where it has to meet the warranty conditions in order to be repaired and sent back and I was not willing to take that risk. The quickest  solution unfortunately was to buy a new one. Now that new controller started bugging since the first month and it has been consistently getting worst. Today it is almost impossible to play without it being in the way of gameplay. I find it very unfair to have to buy 3 controllers in a 6 month period when I have taken good care of them.,6 people found this helpful

M. LaShelle,5.0 out of 5 stars,A-,the United States ,December 4 2017,Verified Purchase,"  The short bit: I love it! However, the menu design could be a little simpler and easier to locate some things I didn't have any trouble with on PS3. Wish I could give it a 4.5 but 5 stars is fine. Not to say the visual design isn't nice and useful occasionally. Just lots of stuff I am not going to use.  There are notifications that help you to learn where things are. So, that helps anything negative I have to say.Couple first impression pros and cons:It got a little warm on the cheap paint in this new house. Feet got stuck and one popped off. Great no-glue design to pop it right back in there. Sticky feet would not have been smart. (Just like with many other devices that get a little warm.)I haven't had an issue with it getting hot. Just warm. Put it in rest mode and it will cool down pretty fast between games.I love rest mode. Solves the controller power problem. You can also set when the USBs stop funneling power to other devices.Load times are ridiculous but if you're playing from a first release disc it will let you skip the updates and start playing. Thank goodness. If you're planning to load a couple games and set things up in the menu before you begin, you're looking at 2-3 hours. I fell asleep waiting on updates the first time I plugged it in.It will sometimes error out of games and send an error report. Something I never experienced with PS3. But, being a Mac user, as long as they stay on top of those updates and actually fix them I'm game. Tbd. I'll come back and play later. Haven't had an issue with that so far. It only errored out once in the last two weeks. Came back later and was able to play.PS4 Slim is about the same size as PS3 Slim without the awkward shape and sacrificing features. It's a hell of a lot heavier but times have changed.Careful removing plugs from the back. They're real snug on this one. Hurt my hand a few times. I'm not sure if that's good or bad. I guess it depends on the situation. I like magnets that snap off. Macbooks have spoiled me.Still my favorite way to play games! I strictly work on my computers in a field that requires a lot of processing power. So, I stick to consoles. They don't need all that negativity in my free time too. Haha All around improved in the social entertainment and app entertainment category. I like it so far.However, my review of the mic it comes with is not so sunny: Sony Playstation 4 (PS4) Mono Chat Earbud with Mic   https://www.amazon.com/gp/review/R2DUSC7R2IRWTZ?ref_=glimp_1rv_cl Very cheap.

Chloe Reece,5.0 out of 5 stars,Space saver gaming unit with a quiet engine!,the United States ,December 27 2017,Verified Purchase,"  The PS4 came perfect upon arrival. I received a PS4 game for Christmas and was excited on opening the PS4 unit the day after. After the initial set up and connections, the PS4 quickly recognized my game and I was able to play it with family members. The unit is quiet and a space-saver! People have two ways to lay the unit. It's convenient to have it stand on its side. After owning the Ps2 for many years, the PS4 really packs a great engine to produce the high-quality pictures through the HDMI cord to the TV. The loading transition is very minimal. I give this 5 stars!",One person found this helpful

Just don't know why I have to wait that long...",the United States ,March 28 2018,Verified Purchase,"  Does not work, right from the box it was broken. Could not return. Our family took a rare vacation to visit family this Christmas, by the time we gothome, and our children opened their gifts here, the was PlayStation was out of warranty to return. Luckily, I had also bought the protection planfrom Square Trade. I do recommend that to everyone that is offered that for their electronics. The warranty is still in effect for the PlayStationthrough the Sony company. We have already sent it in once, and it came back the same. They are continuing to work with me on this in the  hopes of figuring out the problem with the console.This system costs a lot of money, along with it I bought games, contriollers, and other supplies. It is disappointing that my children's biggest and most wanted Christmas gift can not be used, could not ever be used because it will not connect to the tv. That it is nearly April, and they are still waiting. I don't understand why a brand new never used PlayStation could not be replaced with another one, quick and simple.I do not know why I had to buy a HDMI cord, to see if the cord is the problem. And they could not of checked that while it was in service.Since it has been a connection problem, from the beginning.",11 people found this helpful

mcgeehe,5.0 out of 5 stars,"It's a PS4 for $200, how could this go any other way?",the United States ,November 21 2017,Verified Purchase,"  I got this during the Black Friday sale (2017) for $200. For that price, it's a great deal, IMO. You get a nice Blu-Ray player and streaming box that can also play PS4 exclusives @ 1080p, it compliments my PC very well. Don't think I'd pay more than $200 for one though unless I didn't have a gaming PC. Don't think I could recommend PS+, you get all the same benefits on PC for no extra charge, but if you happen to want to play a PS4 game online, there isn't any other option. At the normal price of $300, I'd give this a 3 out of 5 stars.Amazon/USPS delivered next day (Prime WA to WA) <3",14 people found this helpful

The machine has plenty of memory for ...,the United States ,January 16 2018,Verified Purchase,  I used to be an Xbox guy but I prefer the PlayStation now simply because the machine is much more customizable and much more convenient when it comes to online subscriptions and online services are pretty good. The machine has plenty of memory for games and the download speed is pretty good. Also there is a wide range of games to play including virtual reality Wich isn't found on any other console platform. I didn't Kno that PlayStation 4 controllers have built in mouse touch on them and speakers. I was amazed when I first noticed sounds coming out of my controller also there is an indicator light that let's you know where your battery life is and the light reacts with games for example it turns red when you're health is low in a game or blue or green when you're health is fine. All in all PlayStation is a cool machine. As long as you have a TV that has HDMI input you can turn it on and start gaming,One person found this helpful

MooseTop Contributor: Camping,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best ever!! ?,the United States ,November 24 2017,Verified Purchase,"  Update:12/25/17 We have a winner! I could attempt to tell you, in highly technical terms, why this system rocks. But I would fail. So I will just say I have the happiest 10 year old in the world. PS4 is worth $1000. Get one.Original review: So with the possible exception of a bra, I cannot think of anything I am less qualified to review than a game system. Last video game I played was Space Invaders and that was 1977. But I did my research and read my reviews and I think I got the best one. Most important it’s the one my 10 year old son wants. And after consulting with my 26 and 24 year old sons, I went for it. So this is a provisional 5 stars to be amended after Christmas as necessary. lol My sons recommend.

Even the WPS (WiFi Protection Setup) was having issues at first connecting but it eventually did.

I have not had one blue screen yet with this system. Had to replace my older PS4  due to what I suspect is a power supply failure. This one has much better internet connection over WiFi than the one I replaced. Haven't experienced the full lobby one second, mass exodus of players later issue in GTA, not that it is always a bad thing... But, still seems like PSN is still slowing downloads. As even over a 100gbs connection is still slow to download full games, or DLC.  That is not the systems fault though. I like the smaller foot print this system has.

I mean it's a Sony PS console so there's usually not much to complain about unless you get a factory defect I guess.  I appreciate that the price was reasonable so we can all play together on separate consoles as a family (some games are not available as, or are horrible as, a split screen mode).It would be nice if Sony as a company would allow PS Plus accounts to be used across several consoles (like Netflix allows accounts across a few different users on different screens) so we had to sign our kiddo up for a separate account to use and play a lot of the games with friends or even with us in the same house.",0 people found this helpful

Matthew McGinley (real name™),2.0 out of 5 stars,I figured out what the deal is...,the United States ,October 10 2019,purchase not verified,"  The PS4, Playstation 4, has the best graphics to date. Mind blowing, ultra-realistic graphics. The console is very quiet and the 1 TB drive is unbelievably responsive and efficient. However, the whole idea of gaming now with the PS4 is that of commerciality, or perpetual purchases. On the older systems, the PS1 and PS2, for example, when you bought a game, all of the features were on the disc, although some of them may have been locked. The way it works now is they practically give you the game for a token payment. When you set up your playstation account, then they have you. Now you have to buy ""extras"" for the game online, and in many cases you have to be online to play your game, so Sony is always watching you. Instead of a complete game for $49, for example, you pay $29 for the initial game, but to get all the bonuses, extras and ""easter eggs"" you might have to pay up to $500 or more, $1.49 or $2.99 at a time. It really is marketing genius.Once I realized how it works now, then I immediately sold my system and regressed back to the PS2, the best game platform ever made--a contradiction to my earlier statement. I say this because with the older systems you are safe, off the grid, and Sony or Big Brother cannot see you or track what you are doing. I like it better this way. Safer. Cleaner. More secure. Cozy and safe, away from watchful eyes and hacks that could somehow break into your account and steal your financial data making you a target for identity thieves who could easily steal your bank account information. That's the way the PS4, and soon-to-be-released PS5  systems work now--everything is done online, and very little of it now is done off the grid, away from the mainframe and spying corporate eyes who are going to milk you for every dollar. I hope this information helps you, too, avoid potential financial problems and being a victim of profiteering pricing.Another thing is, you have no power to stop the updates. The game will get to a point where it will not let you play it until it is updated, even if you have the physical CD for it. This is so not right. If the game is not finished or it needs updating, why not wait until it's done instead of half-baked? So, as I mentioned, with the older PS1 and PS2, there are thousands of games already done for those systems that don't need updating and don't need an internet connection to play, so the best move is one step forward, three steps back, and that's where I will stay.I hope there are some programmers out there who write new games for the ps1 and ps2 and cause an older game system revival. I hope there are some marketing people and programmers who have a SHRED of respect for their customers and not just their own bank accounts.From the navigation menu, there is no option to delete your Playstation account. You have to call a phone number and tell them WHY, which is really none of their business. All these voice command things like Alexa, Infinity and now Playstation getting their mitts deeper into our lives and our pockets--do not let them do this. Sell your system and detach yourself from the grid! It's so much safer that way.",2 people found this helpful

AJ,3.0 out of 5 stars,Good but Xbox is better,the United States ,July 23 2019,purchase not verified,"  I own both a PS4 and an Xbox so this is going to be a direct comparison. I am not going to compare graphics of the two systems because they basically identical. One of the reasons I prefer Xbox over PS4 is the Xbox controller feels more comfortable in my hands. also I bought a battery pack for the controller and it lasts a lot longer than the PS4 rechargeable controller. I find I have to recharge my PS4 controller after several hours, even if I don't use it for a few days the battery dies. I also find Xbox user interface to be more intuitive. For some reason my PS4 hard drive filled up a lot quicker. I know not all games are the same size but after only installing 3 or 4 games on my PS4 the hard drive was almost full.I had to delete some demos and other things I had on there in order to free up space. I was able to download about a dozen games to my Xbox. Big ones like Halo 5 and red Dead redemption. I can only assume it has something to do with the differences and operating systems, the hard drives are the same size. The PS4 does not look aesthetically pleasing and when I pick it up it feels like a cheaper piece of equipment. This next reason is very important: I've had a lot of network issues with the PS4. ive had a lot of trouble getting on to the PlayStation Network and finding matches online. Nothing is more frustrating than trying to play a game with your friends and getting disconnected. I have not had the same problems with my Xbox. I did some research and a lot of people have been having the same issues with their PS4. The one advantage PS4 has is its share play feature, where you can share games with friends. I'll let you research that for yourselves. Xbox games seem to go down in price faster which is a good thing. PlayStation is seen as just a gaming system. They don't have a lot of apps for watching television or a Blu-ray player. Xbox has a built-in Blu-ray player and far more apps to download then PlayStation. it's not known as just a gaming system but an entertainment system.  Now I know PlayStation sold more consolesbut Xbox is an all-around better piece of equipment. If you're thinking about buying a console you might want to wait until next year when the new systems come out. Hope this review helped.",One person found this helpful

Phillip,5.0 out of 5 stars,My initial reaction. ??Enjoy the review,the United States ,December 27 2018,purchase not verified,  I gave 5 only because I wanted to rant but didn’t want this guys rating to go down.To begin. These games are for “attention disorder” people. And everyone says if you play these type of games then your “ a d d”. Well after 45 minutes of waiting for a game to “load”.? Yeah if this is for a d d people then I must just be a raging mad lunitic. Are you kidding me? 45 minutes to get to play a game that 5 seconds into it. I didn’t like the stupid game. So move to next one. O LORD!!! Really! ANOTHER 45 minutes? What a d d kid can sit thru this? Guess what. You don’t have a d d. Each time I wanna try a new game. I have to wait 45 minutes. Why are we still producing the physical CD? Just to download a 14gb file. What is 14gb? The whole game is only 10gb ! I swear! Make my tax dollars pay for ignorance people call a d d. By definition ! That type of person would never be able to install the wires! Much less wait thru that crap!! We have an xbox360. Guess what. It grew dust from sitting. Because of this. Just absolute insanity. Go get a job. Retrain your focus ability. 45 minutes to start to play a game. I won’t go back to Disney. Because the fast pass is still too slow in lines. THATS A D D! Needless to say. It hasn’t turned back on after second CD attempt. The v r was cool till each of got motion sickness. So now it’s a novelty on the shelf. I would rather force some one to listen to my rant than to ever turn that junk back on. Fun my butt. Who wants to wait? This day in technology? Really ? A game that competes with instant cell phone games? Wish this could be returned. But now we $600 in the hole because HO HO brought it!  Fat cheerful basterd. He ain’t gotta sit thru the loading of a game like this dad. But hey. One mans opinion is worthless. So 5 stars,0 people found this helpful
Outrun1986,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Best game console on the market, an absolute must-own.",the United States ,April 15 2018,purchase not verified,"  Best game console on the market, many very high quality games under $20 each, some even cheaper. This is the console that every gamer must own. I got one to play the Digimon games which you cannot play anywhere else. The interface is better than the PS3, which I also own and of course, the system is faster. I haven't had any problems with mine yet. The only problem is a lot of the TV network apps are missing, and the Spectrum TV app is missing so I cannot watch TV through this, I had to buy a Roku to access this stuff, but it would be nice if it was on Playstation so I could save space and cords in my entertainment stand. It would be especially nice if the Spectrum app was not missing as I could watch TV through my Playstation and not have to buy an extra device to do that, especially important since Spectrum no longer offers cable through a wire that plugs into the back of your TV, you have to either pay a very expensive monthly fee for a cable box or find a way to access the app to watch TV. This app is on Xbox so I don't know why its not on Playstation. I am not buying another gaming system just to access an app.",0 people found this helpful
LD,2.0 out of 5 stars,Disappointing...,the United States ,February 6 2018,purchase not verified,"  I've owned the PS4 since launch (and therefore paid upwards of $500 for it) and it has to be said...it is really disappointing.  In my opinion Sony really dropped the ball with the PS4.  I am 35 yo and have owned every Playstation that has come out, the first PS, PS2 (which I had and used for 10 YEARS with no issues), the original PS3, a PS3 slim (which I had to buy to replace my PS3 fat when it died 3 years after purchase), and now a launch PS4.  The god's honest truth is I still use my PS3 slim more than I use my PS4, even to this day.  The ONLY thing that the PS4 does that the PS3 can't is play PS4 games, THAT'S IT!  Unless you are a hardcore console gamer (which I am not, I am mostly a PC gamer), the PS4 is and always has been a total waste of money.  I bought the PS4 as a home theater device, to do everything, and I expected it to be at least somewhat future proofed with the firmware updates.  The fact that it can't play 4k blu rays or stream in 4k is a massive disappointment.  I am now in the position of having to purchase something else (PS4 pro, Xbox One S, Roku, etc) in order to take advantage of my 4k TV.  If you are looking at one of these now, certainly don't bother, get the Pro.",0 people found this helpful

You couldn't erase notifications, getting messages and notifications from a party after you've left/deleted it, things like that. They have  worked out most of the issues, auto update is still a little funky but is acceptable. The console hardware is top notch, of coarse. Great graphics and game play. SUPER  reliable., I'm still on my original system (bought when original Destiny was released). I put hundreds of hours every winter on this thing and it just keeps working  I've owned every Playstation yet and this is my favorite. The dualshock I got with the system had the L3 button go out. It was in warranty so they took it and ""fixed"" it but when it came back the L3 button worked but the left stick didn't work properly anymore. Bought a new one and still have it but the battery life is bad. Bought a new one a few months ago and the battery life on the new ones are much better. Left a bad review earlier but after spending some time with it and some software issues being resolved I wanted to set the record straight. Great system..",0 people found this helpful
"Lonnie K. Coates, Jr.",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Good System, but Sony Has No Respect for their Fans",the United States ,April 22 2019,purchase not verified,"  The PS4 is a good system. It has a decent selection of games, from fighting games, to shooters, and ect. Despite the positives, the PS4 does come with some drawbacks. You can't use a laptop hdd, internally, that is larger than 2TB due to a physical size restriction, you can't play 4K Blu Ray discs on this console, but you can do this on most Xbox One consoles, and crossplay support on the system is not that great on the system. The big offender for me is how Sony starting to censor certain Japanese games for there sexy content such as Senran Kagura Burst Re:Newal, and the upcoming Super Neptunia RPG. Frankly I find this grossly disrespectful to their fanbase by them treating us like a bunch of babies. Honestly, if you like JRPGs, just get Switch (and a PC), and let Sony know that they're terrible for treating their fans like this.",One person found this helpful
Colin,5.0 out of 5 stars,Worth every penny!,the United States ,September 7 2018,purchase not verified,"  Got this last year and has been using this wonderful console ever since. I don't have a 4K TV so this PS4 Slim model is exactly what I need. There are plenty of storage and if needed, I can always purchase additional external hard drives for more room. Playstation has so many great exclusives: so far I played the Uncharted series, Horizon Zero Dawn, and Crash Bandicoot; while God of War, The Last of Us, Shadow of the Colossus, Bloodborne, Yakuza, Detroit: Become Human, and Gravity Rush 2 are on my to-play list next. I also played other multi-platform games like FFXV, Assassin's Creed (Ezio trilogy and Unity) and Dynasty Warriors 8, which all ran very smoothly. Boot time is extremely quick and with backwards compatibility, I can also enjoy playing other PS3 games. In addition, the Playstation online store always have really good flash sales in which even AAA title games are 60-80% off so it does definitely pay off to keep an eye out for those.",One person found this helpful

Patrick L,4.0 out of 5 stars,XBOX SUCKS,the United States ,May 1 2019,purchase not verified,"  A Better Playstation The Sony Playstation is a state of the art console gaming system. It can run endless amounts of games as well as stream movies, TV shows, and even music. It is a great piece of technology and I am proud to have one in my home. Playstation also features a symmetrical design on its controllers as well as on the console itself, so it is even satisfying to just look at. With all of these upsides to a Sony Playstation there has to be a couple downsides. There is not very much storage to hold games and the fan gets loud when running large online games. Other than these issues, the PS4 is an excellent console.Playstations are a perfect example of modern technology. They are equipped with massive graphics chips that can run hundreds of games. Everything from Call of Duty to even fitness games are available for the PS4.  Playstations truly are state of the art consoles. This console is guaranteed to bring its owner joy. Every time I start up my PS4 I get immediate happiness towards it because I know I will have fun.  The PS4 comes from a long line of predecessors so it has had time to evolve into the beast of a gaming machine that it is. Sony has gone through ups and downs with its gaming consoles. However the PS4 lies amongst their greatest achievements. With all of these great features available on the PS4, there are of course some downsides.Unfortunately the Playstation only comes standard with a single terabyte of storage. This is only enough to hold a maximum of seven to ten games. If a Playstation owner wishes to keep more games than this, he or she has to plug in an external storage source, like a USB drive or external hard drive. Video games take up massive amounts of storage and need to be saved on massive hard drives, so personally I believe the console could use more storage. When I buy a video game I like to keep it, so to me it is basically throwing money down the drain when I have to uninstall an old game to make room for a new one. The PS4 could definitely use more storage to keep even more games.Another problem with the Playstation is its fan. When running large games, especially online ones, the fan is obnoxious. I have to use headphones sometimes because the volume of the fan is louder than the volume of my television. I have always seen the solution to this noise as better air flow to the console. By propping up the console and keeping it in a cool area the fan does not seem to be as loud, but it is still clearly there. If Sony designed their playstation with better air flow, I believe the loud fan problem will be fixed.Overall I love the Sony Playstation. It is an excellent gaming console and I will probably own one for as long as I play video games. The PS4 runs games efficiently and usually with no problems. The only things that need to be fixed on the PS4 are its storage and the loud fan. Other than those two small complications, the system is excellent and is at the top of its class in video gaming consoles.",0 people found this helpful
Issac Ornelas,5.0 out of 5 stars,Can playstation get any better than what it already is or can xbox spet ...,the United States ,February 16 2018,purchase not verified,"  “Playstation sold 201 million consoles in 2004”. Imagine the amount of damage done now that two console have release since 2004. Can playstation get any better than what it already is or can xbox spet their game up on how to make a console. Read more to understand what many people want to know how this big debate can be settled.  I am also a big gamer because I know what I’m doing and I do it very well. Since my K/D ratio is higher than the average chump and higher rank than the noob on my team going 2-23 because he just got the game with either his christmas money and/or his birthday money. I can get angry but with the right controller such as the Playstation I can play on and on and on, but not even the controller itself is the only thing that helps the great graphics and all as well. Have I convinced you yet that I know what i’m talking when it comes to game consoles.  Since I have convinced you enough to go on to the next paragraph, let me tell you that it can only get better and better from here on out. Gamers is not just a hobby its a life when it gets taken to a whole other level when it comes to K/D ratio and even win in Fortnite and Call of Duty WWII. I’m the guy that everyone needs on their team. I’m the guy everyone intives, I’m the guy who the other team doesn’t like, I’m the guy who steals packages. I’m the guy on the battlefield everyday. I’m the guy to get it done. After years of testing out consoles I’ve have chosen the PlayStation because of the great review it had and my father has the PlayStation as even most of my friends have a PlayStation. Since that was the case when the PlayStation 3 came out it was about 189$ and it seemed a little high but once my parents bought it for my birthday it lasted about 8 years until the newest Playstation 4 came out in November 13, 2014 and I got it on February 13th 2015. It still works like it is new and I hope it last as long as it is until the PlayStation 5 come outs around 2022.  On the other hand it can suck because it has a maulfacting on the disc when you try to insert a disc within 3 years but it still takes disc. It can also have some controller issues on the buttons but controllers cost a bit too much around 65.99. It has some ups and some down. Xbox has better graphics for sport games and PlayStation has better graphics for shooters. Both play Blu-ray and have 4k support.Other might say that Xbox is better because of the following reasons, since I have spoken to student who doesn’t agree that Playstation is better. He stated, “It has better exclusive games, better graphics, and also it doesn’t have the same features and the same techniques used.”  They both have there advantages but as I walked around the school asking most said they did like Xbox until they got a Playstation and now they think its a whole lot better.",One person found this helpful
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,A Great Console,the United States ,February 17 2019,purchase not verified,"  For years, there has been much debate and comparisons between Playstation and Xbox over who has the superior product. No matter which console system you decide to choose, you cannot go wrong with the PlayStation 4 Slim. This product offers a smaller and cheaper step into the PlayStation world. This world offering exclusive game titles, streaming services, and much more. Although it is smaller in size, the Slim provides a great experience for anyone of any age on a budget who shares an interest in gaming.DesignThe PlayStation 4 console series provides options to choose between separate types of the PlayStation 4 to fit the best needs and budgets of its users. For the Slim specifically, it is similar to the PlayStation 4 Pro’s build and comes with the same color variability as well as the plastic matte exterior making the product noticeably lighter given the size. The Pro design is measured at 12 x 10.8 inches while the Slim comes in at 11.3 x 10.4 inches. Although, the Pro may offer more due to its higher price, all of the basic needs for a gamer are found in the Slim for a cheaper price and almost the same design.DurabilityAn unorthodox example of this product’s durability was when I accidentally spilled water on the exterior of the Slim. I was terrified that my PlayStation would never work again and I would be out of a gaming console. After cleaning the Slim off, and making sure it was as dry as possible, I found no issues whatsoever. This accident happened a few months ago and I still have yet to have problems. I cannot guarantee this will be the same for all products but it just proves how durable this product really is. Also, this product has great mobility. As long as you are being cautious with the cords that come with it, it is easy to take to and from. I am able to fit the Slim into my backpack comfortably with its accessories and bring it on the road with no problems. This product continues to surprise me with its excellent durability.MediaWhat separates Playstation apart, is it’s offering of exclusive titles only to it’s consoles. The titles including Uncharted, The Last of Us, and God of War. Although they provide exclusive titles, there are still hundreds of games both physically and digitally available for this product. If you subscribe to the PlayStation Network, which is an additional fee, you’ll be able to gain access to even more titles which can be downloaded right to your library. It also offers membership discounts, sales, free games and the opportunity to play with your friends as well as other gamers around the world. Aside from games, it also provides many other apps and streaming services such as Netflix, Hulu, Youtube or whatever streaming service your heart desires! You can play music through Spotify and other apps directly off of the PS4.There are many advantages that comes with this product such as it’s design, durability and the media it provides. It offers a great first step into PlayStation’s world at an inexpensive price for any person of any age. It comes as a great option, whether it be for kids, teens, and even adults. Despite its size, the PlayStation 4 Slim is a great console that is your own home entertainment system.",0 people found this helpful

KJB,4.0 out of 5 stars,This is a good low costing PlayStation 4,the United States ,February 8 2018,purchase not verified,"  This is a good low costing PlayStation 4. Its can play a very wide range of new games on the market without trouble. It also has a slim console which can be both a good and bad thing depending on what you are using it for, and how long you’re using the system. At a low price and a full terabyte of memory it’s a very good bargain.Getting a PS4 which is currently at the front of console entertainment for under 300 dollars is already a good deal. Do remember if this is the first time your buying a PlayStation you will also have to purchase games, which range anywhere from 30 to 60 dollars per game. But to get a brand new PS4 and a few games to play starting out for under 500 dollars is a good deal.Also, if you have a Netflix subscription you can stream hundreds of TV shows and movies straight to your television. If you get a PS4 I would highly recommend getting a Netflix or Hulu subscription for a low price per month.You have a lot of potential when you get a full terabyte of memory for games and other features. Many play stations do not have that much memory, and often have to purchase an external memory drive. With this model of PlayStation, you still have the option of using external memory drives but more than likely will not need to unless used in excess.The slim model of the PlayStation is both a benefit and a potential issue. When using the PlayStation for long periods of time (3 hours or more) it will often get hot and could potentially over heat. This can be easily solved by a small USB computer fan to keep it cool. Keeping the top of the system open with nothing on top of it can also help this issue. However, this issue aside the slim design is a good design and is much more compact than other PlayStation.If you decided to buy a PlayStation and it is your fist time buying a PlayStation or a console like system I recommend buying a couple various kinds of games. An open world combat game could be more to your liking or a first-person shooter like Battlefield 1 or Overwatch.  I would also recommend looking into Fort Night a free to play game on the PlayStation store.",0 people found this helpful
Cavan,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Optical drive fails after hardly any use, half the price of console to fix.",the United States ,May 29 2019,purchase not verified,"  The price should really be about $550 once you consider the optical drive failing and the cost of repair, which I’m sure they have. I bought a PS4 slim brand new and am an extremely light user. I mean I buy a game maybe once or twice a year. And after a year and a half of mostly just sitting there, the optical drive completely fails. And I can send it to Sony for $150 or take it to someone local where I find out my particular model of optical drive is $100 so with labor and tax comes out to be $150 give or take.

You could put the console on rest mode which updates your games even when your not playing on low power so it doesn't use much electricity. The only thing I didn't like is that the games are kinda much like the xbox too. You can't change your gamertag. If you want a new one, then you just have to make a whole new account. And the main reason is that truthfully when I bought one, the only game I wanted to play was the black ops 2 game. Which sony doesn't do. So I will be going back to the xbox one.

Originally game updates were taking up to 80 hours (you read that right) to complete so I had to buy a new router to speed things up to the 4-12 hour mark.All online gameplay now requires a subscription to PS+ as well.From the perspective of a responsible working adult, my overall gaming experience has gotten worse not better.

J. Summers,1.0 out of 5 stars,Can't Even Replace the PS3 - Epic Fail on DVD/BluRay,the United States ,August 1 2018,purchase not verified,"  I wanted to actually upgrade from Playstation 3, but Playstation 4 totally misses the mark on being the whole-life-replacement that the Playstation 3 was.  For me, I use Netflix, Hulu, Amazon, and DVD/BluRay about 500x more often than gaming features, which isn't to say I don't use gaming features, haha.  But Playstation 4 requires an extra step to get to the first 3 which requires loading a completely stupid TV menu (and loading, of course, wastes time).  And PS4 COMPLETELY FAILS on DVDs and BluRay.  Yes, they play.  Fine.  Glitches for some, but not for me.  But every time a disc is put in, the PS4 loads it like it's the first time.I need a system that remembers the last dozen or more DVDs/BluRay I've put in, because I use home workout DVDs on a constant rotation, 2 per day and different each day.  Half of them have annoyingly long first-time loading segments.  PS3 skips these after I've used the disc once.  Totally perfect.  PS4 doesn't even remember THE LAST DISC USED!  So, yeah, I ripped out the PS4 and plugged back in the PS3.I haven't decided whether I'm keeping the PS4 yet for gaming, but it sure as heck can't replace the PS3.  The PS3 makes every other system obsolete for every purpose except gaming.  The PS4 can't even replace its own predecessor!!  Epic fail for non-gaming.Other cons: (1) Huge push for community features makes every single screen obnoxiously full of stupid community options (as my boyfriend said: they could at least ASK you if you give an F about that crap, and let you turn it off).  (2) turning it on and off is now a stupidly long affair.  It was bad enough to have to hit the PS button, tap down to turn off the system, and confirm (PS3).  Now, if you don't want it to rest, you have to scroll through multiple menus.  Geez.  (3) POP UPS you can't turn off.  Again, the controller battery reminders were bad enough on the PS3, but now ""Discovery""?!  And never anything I care about.  Ridiculously horrible user experience!  If they cared what WE wanted rather than just trying to sell their stupid features, they'd ask a brief survey during setup to see what kind of user you are, and then tailor Discovery to you, at least.  Or, I don't know: Give us the option to shut off their intrusive pop-ups?—you know, the most hated UI element ever in the history of technology?I hate the PS4.",4 people found this helpful

Where the Xbox would lag, stutter and randomly disconnect from the internet (as well as a host of other issues) the PS4 has done none of those things. It's very fast. The UI is great. The build quality is better. The graphics are better and the games are better.The reason I decided to switch was not on my own accord, Xbox decided to ban me out of the blue and for literally no reason, I've never cheated, cursed, or done anything even remotely close to being a bannable offense, with that being said, I'm glad they did and my only regret is that they didn't do it sooner.

Now you have to pay to use the multiplayer service and again, it's worse than when it was free on the ps3. Not to mention you pay $60 for a game that I honestly would be ashamed to say I had even just done the artwork for. On top of everything else, you spend a lot of money for new map packs and they are tiney. Sony and sledgehammer games need to get their s### together.

Patrick Fewell,1.0 out of 5 stars,Useless piece of garbage,the United States ,November 25 2017,purchase not verified,"  Useless piece of garbage. Almost every time there is an update, it bricks the PS4. I have to completely wipe out the system and reinstall everything to get it working again. This is kept at my ex's house, and it is a major pain for her to disconnect it, bring it to me, just so I can wipe everything back to a complete reinstall of the operating system. A manual update does not work. It has to be a manual reinstall of everything. Such a horribly bad design. Whats worse is that wifi does not work on a manual install. It has to be by cat5/6 cable or by a usb flash drive. Unfortunately, there is no tv by the router, and the computer cannot take HDMI inputs, making this even harder. I never have to deal with these problems with the Xbox one. Updates should not brick the system, even with novice users. Manual updates that are provided should work. What is the point of allowing people to download an update, if they work 0% of the time? Sony had better think twice if they expect me to ever waste another dime on the ps4 with updates like this.",6 people found this helpful

Nadav Har'El,1.0 out of 5 stars,Get a different console....,the United States ,November 29 2017,Verified Purchase,"  I bought my son this console because he asked, and now sorry about not convincing him to get the XBox instead.It looks like the PlayStation was literally designed to annoy me. Setting it up was hell, taking hours. Then I realized that Sony is like an even worse kind of Apple, patronizing over its customers and enjoying making them jump through hoops all the time. Examples? I have many:1. I truthfull entered my son's young age, and lo and behold - he can't watch youtube because he's not 13. Not even if I remove all ""parental restrictions"".2. We bought several games on CDs, and now my son needs to switch those CDs physically to play, despite the full copy of the game being copied to the hard disk? Why? Because what the heck, we are Sony, and we own you. So annoying.3. I was asked to choose which age-level games I wanted my son to play. Setting anything except ""all ages"" means that he can't play most games, even silly benign games, so I had to remove this restriction. Nice ass-covering, Sony!4. The playstation doesn't support our language, Hebrew. I did not expect Hebrew translations, just a simple Hebrew keyboard so my son can type Hebrew strings into search boxes in the browser, etc. WTF? Every $50 android supports a Hebrew keyboard. Microsoft X-Box supports Hebrew. Only Sony doesn't. Who cares that there are about 7 million people who want this language.5. The Netflix version on PS4 is full of bugs. E.g., I'm stuck on one of the 5 Netflix users, and can't change it. Why?All this would be OK (or NOT!) for some $50 gaming machine. Not for a system I just spent over $400 on (console, extra controller, games). Stay away!",11 people found this helpful

They were perfectly happy taking my money when I purchased a game through their awful store but when they couldn't deliver the pre order bonus that was promised to me they told me to contact the developer and then hung up on me. TWICE!!!!! When I say they have the worst customer service I have ever experienced, it is an understatement. I WILL NEVER EVER BUY ANY SONY PRODUCT EVER IN MY LIFE!!!!!

Kay,1.0 out of 5 stars,ATTRACTS ROACHES!,the United States ,October 18 2017,purchase not verified,"  We only had this a month before it stopped powering on anymore. When I disassembled the console, I found several *roaches* inside. We are fairly neat and don't usually see roaches around the house or even in the kitchen, but this is southeast Texas and they're kind of a fact of life here even with quality weather-proofing. They are attracted to the inside of this console because it's so compact and the power supply is inside, instead of in an external box like older models used to have, which makes the entire unit hot. This is a major design flaw in the first place, much less to not cover the ventilation points with mesh or something that will keep pests and dust out of it. We ordered a replacement power supply and I hope I'll be able to fix my machine, as I've discovered there's a provision in the warranty where it is voided if there are any insects found inside. This indicates Sony KNOWS about the problem and has not resolved it. If I can repair the machine, I'll have to bag it up in some screen or something just to keep it alive.

But that's not what this is about.The ps4 has been amazing. The ability to easily create multiple profiles for the people and visitors to my home, the ease of installation, updates, and locating information have made this system our favorite. While some might like that it plays DVDs and bluray, we actually like it for its ability to function without needing constant system or software updates that render it or the games unplayable (**** you xbox), which is wonderful for those of us that live rurally. The ps4 comes out of the box ready to play (after a very short initial set up) and the same can be said for the games.I will be buying another for our house because we enjoy this one immensely.",One person found this helpful

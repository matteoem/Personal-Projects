JD,1.0 out of 5 stars,THIS UNIT IS USED!!!!! Not new !,the United States ,August 18 2018,Verified Purchase,"  I’d give zero stars if I could.  Buyer Beware.  This is a used unit, and mine didn’t even work properly.  The disc drive didn’t work, so I contacted Microsoft onkhbrk find out my warranty expires in 5 months instead of a year.  So in other words this is a used unit not new!  So I’m sending it back without the box since I threw that out a week ago.  I was only playing downloaded games and today decided to put in a disc.  Low and behold the used Xbox didn’t work.  Getting a refund",218 people found this helpful
Daniella,1.0 out of 5 stars,Such a disappointment! Didn’t even work!,the United States ,November 27 2018,Verified Purchase,"  If I could give this product zero stars, I would. It didn’t even arrive at my house, I had to pick it up from some quick mart liquor store. Then once I opened it and set everything up, IT DIDNT EVEN TURN ON! I tried everything to fix the problem. Using a different outlet, waiting a while to restart it, using a different cord. Nothing worked so I took it to my friend who fixes electronics and he said it’s nonrepairable. The only that worked was the remote controller which I gave to my brother and the game it came with.",121 people found this helpful

kris suitos,5.0 out of 5 stars,Seller is amazing....would buy from him again,the United States ,April 27 2018,Verified Purchase,"  My son got his first job and wanted to buy himself something. He ordered this. When the unit came the controller had a rattling noise and the cord to the unit fit loosely.  My son set up the unit and everything else seemed to work ok. The seller immediately sent me an email once the item was ordered letting me know that if there are any issues to please contact him immediately.  Since it was not something I used on a daily basis I kept forgetting to ask my son if everything was working properly. The seller followed up with another email and I finally asked my son if everything was good with his purchase.  My son repeated to me that the controller was not the best and the power cord was loose and he had to keep fixing it. I emailed the seller who immediately sent a new controller. Still waiting on the power cord, but I would purchase from this seller anytime. He is big on customer service and selling a good quality product. I greatly appreciated the email follow up to ensure that we were happy with the purchase we had made. My son was so happy to have a controller that worked properly.",68 people found this helpful
M. Koller,4.0 out of 5 stars,Bit of a glitchy model.,the United States ,August 30 2018,Verified Purchase,"  Shipment was very quick. However, when I pulled it out of the box and began setting it up, I did notice that the supplied hard drive has a few problems. Applications hang at times, and games saved to the hard drive have occasionally crashed requiring a return to the Home screen or a full restart of the console.

Fabian M.,4.0 out of 5 stars,USED/REFURBISHED,the United States ,April 27 2019,Verified Purchase,"  The Xbox one I received was very well packaged, although finding out these units are used the hard way was a big hit in the gut. I wish the seller was honest and mentioned it was refurbished. Other than very minor scuff(s) and the entrance to the power cord was off it's axis from inside the Xbox by like 3cm and made  me have to use more force to install a simple power cord and only Because it's off by those 3cm. In other words this unit of mine particularly the one I got. May have been (opened) for repairs. Warranty sticker is still intact. But from my expiereice those are easy to remove and Put on again other than that perfmance is great runs all my games connects toy WiFi with no issues. Comes with 1 controller no game.

Lonely Neuron,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Working well now, but...",the United States ,October 8 2018,Verified Purchase,"  The console/controller and a 2nd controller ordered separately arrived promptly, but had two problems (one real and one perceived). The perceived problem was that the power cord could not be securely plugged into the back of the console. After a 30-minute drive to the local Microsoft store, it was demonstrated that if one pushed very (and I mean *very*) hard the plug would insert securely. The other problem was that the controller that came with the console would randomly fail to operate - becoming inoperative after anywhere from a minute to an hour (the separately ordered 2nd controller operated flawlessly). The Microsoft store gladly swapped my defective controller for a new one (though I had to accept a black one rather than white). The new controller is working perfectly.",6 people found this helpful

EVIII,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good merchant Terrible platform,the United States ,September 24 2019,Verified Purchase,"  Had nothing but a good experience from the merchant who sold this.Xbox as a platform is terrible though. Xbox has long been the multiplayer focused platform yet because of design flaws in the system and its always on (but we pretend like its not) requirement when instances of big games being released (like the recent Gears 5) or general server outages it renders the console useless if you cannot ""call home"" to verify your fealty to Microsoft. You have to have already put your machine into offline mode in order to have avoided this which is mostly impossible to predict when it will happen and is simply not possible after the fact of a server outage. Whats worse is you virtually MUST keep it online.Further the system is built around digital distribution from the ground up.  Focus on multiplayer games to sell Xbox live, Games with gold and their psuedo netflix style Game Pass service offer the promise of delivering you games. Yet you own nothing. You only get privilege to access these things so long as you have paid your tithe to Microsoft. Stop paying your subscription fees and those ""free"" games you were given with gold are locked out and inaccessible to you until you DO pay. That keeps you paying, and agreeing to waive more and more of your legal rights each time they feel compelled to take more from you, which 95% of gamers have no clue what they are taking because they just blindly scroll through the terms and conditions just to get to the agree box.Then their gamepass service IS COMPLETELY online required. Despite having a game installed and a valid subscription to it, AND the capacity to run clocks underneath the software that will know when to cut off your access once your subscription cuts off despite not having a connection, you cannot access ANY game pass games offline in any capacity.Everybody talks about it does not have games. That obviously is not true. It has most the same games you would get on PS4 and to a lesser extent Switch. The games where it lacks is exclusives, but technically that is not true. It does have some exclusives, but like with everything else with the console they are hidden and locked away behind digital distribution. When you count how many physical exclusives they have you can just about count them on two hands.The Xbox embodies all the worst traits of gaming this generation. Pointless style over substance (as seen between standard and X model of console that has next to no justification to exist because no games fully utilize its added horsepower)  Demanding you swear fealty and give your rights away in perpetuity, trading money for nothing but revocable licenses, forced online need, focus on multiplayer digital sport type experiences instead of on video games, everything about the platform is bad. Its taking the worst practices in the industry and distilling them to an anti consumer driven digital sports focused machine that is more than happy to take your money but expects you to keep handing it over after any transaction has been completed.While the PS4 (PRO ONLY) and Switch have some similar elements, Microsofts anti consumer products are the only field where they are actually innovating. So do not make the mistake I made and hurt the industry by buying this garbage.I give the merchant 5/5 and Microsoft NEGATIVE 5 out of 5 because it should not even exist in this state, to the point that one day in the future it will require legislation to fix the things they are trying to do with this and future incarnations of the Xbox platform.",One person found this helpful

Unfortunately, it was $500 before and... I’m glad that I didn’t waste thousand dollars from getting it in the first place. Since it took years and now on my 27th birthday (which it has already passed last week), it comes in mail unexpectedly right on time Anyways, so far from my X1 console review. Before and after unboxing... it looks clean and brand new from complete X1 game system itself but unfortunately, I only have one small problem with a battery included controller but... that’s not suppose to be a big deal at all cause I could always get complete battery kit set for the controller itself, no worries from that.

Zak,5.0 out of 5 stars,Pleasantly Surprised!,the United States ,July 9 2019,Verified Purchase,"  For years my wife and I shared the original Xbox One, and with most of the new games being online co-op only we knew we needed to make a change. So here we are looking for a reasonably priced new Xbox, knowing that a new version will be coming out in 2020. Leave it to Amazon to have amazing deals on brand new (still boxed in original packaging) Xboxes!So glad we purchased the Xbox One S! It is significantly smaller than the original Xbox One, and doesn't even need a charging brick!! Talk about updates. Everything was in brand new original packaging and arrived quickly and in great condition. Got the Xbox set up and running the day it arrived, and have been using it everyday since. It's very quiet and has fast response times. My wife already had an Xbox sport controller, so we haven't used the controller that comes with it yet. But it looks great upon arrival and did come with batteries (extra plus, because we don't keep a lot of those lying around).TL;DR we were hesitant about purchasing from Amazon because of the bad reviews, but SO GLAD we did, because our experience was great.

Edward,3.0 out of 5 stars,Not worth the price.,the United States ,July 30 2020,Verified Purchase,  So for the price it’s not worth it. The Xbox X comes out in less than 6 months. This Xbox is looks good and definitely doesn’t lag like my previous Xbox One. I can’t notice any visual difference in game play. In fairness I don’t have a fancy TV but I don’t have a hi-def TV. The controller feels slightly lose. On my Overwatch game the left analog stick drifts right. I would return this item but I’m afraid the process would be too complicated. I’m ok with the mini stalls when turning this Xbox on. I’m hoping I don’t have any major issues before three years. So to recap I have owned three Xbox’s. I like them but this one has got stuck loading twice in three weeks. The controller drifts and feels like the assembly of it is slightly loose. Lastly I don’t think the value is worth it. The speed is better than the Xbox One but that’s the only difference and it’s only a little faster. The Xbox X is coming out soon and not much more. I suggest waiting till it comes out to upgrade.,0 people found this helpful
Jacob,3.0 out of 5 stars,Best of the current gen consoles. Currently.,the United States ,July 18 2019,Verified Purchase,  ****Edit 2-21-2020***I'm on the verge of leaving gaming entirely. As an adult with a full time job. I have sporadic instances to play videogames. The frustration is this: Everytime I boot up my system bam! Update! Then next time bam! Update! Update! The system the games! Maybe 1/5 times I boot up my system it's ready to play the game I intended to play! WHATS THE POINT OF NEXT GEN EXPERIENCES IF I NEVER GET TO PLAY IT!!! This is not the gaming I grew up loving. I've grown to rue current consoles. It's only getting worse!I own all the current gen consoles. After a lil use I can say honestly the Xbox One in its current state is the best overall. The best game selection. The best online marketplace. The best disc drive capabilities (4k). Personally the controller is nice. No silly frills...The UI is probably the weakest link. It functions fine but the blocky Windows phone design is unappealing.Things that would improve this Xbox. Multiple color options (white is boring). Included vertical standing option. Silly to have to buy something extra for a simple purpose. Better UI design.

Brad Portzer,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Open box, not new, but appears unused",the United States ,September 22 2019,Verified Purchase,"  So this specifically pertains to the Xbox One S(New) purchased from Worldwide Distributors. The product arrived in good condition and if it wasn't for reading other reviews I probably wouldn't have noticed anything was off.  The Xbox itself and included accessories appear unused and in factory condition. The issues are that the seals were doubled over, the included trial codes were missing, and the warranty only has 7 months left on a year warranty. What I assume occurs is they purchase the product themselves which activates the warranty, they remove the trial codes to sell them elsewhere and reseal the product so the average consumer would never notice the difference. This to me isn't a dealbreaker, I still got a seemingly unused xbox for a decent price, but I know for others this is a big issue. Now, if the product ends up defective or fails in the next few months because its actually used, thats another issue, and I will return to update this review.",One person found this helpful

I was, however expecting it to be clean, free of dust and finger prints. Which it was not. I was also expecting a controller that was in decent shape. But the controller I got has 4 buttons that stick, making it almost impossible to play any type of racing game, as the throttle always gets stuck.  It looked as if whoever sold this pulled it right out of their living room, wrapped it in bubble wrap then put it in a box and shipped it. It was not clean, There were 6 user profiles still on it. Almost half the space was full with games I could not play. Which I had to uninstall myself. I was not expecting that. I even had to blow the dust out of the console.  I will say, on the plus side it arrived a day earlier than it was scheduled to. Also a plus is that I have had no issues with the console itself.(Other than dirty and half full) It seems to work fine. I would have given this a much higher rating had the seller taken the time to clean it and included a controller that didn't stick.",0 people found this helpful

Microsoft box was clearly opened and re-sealed. All components were present and in working order though. As I have purchased various other Microsoft gaming systems over the years, I can only assume that the package was opened by the original seller in order to remove the ""Freebies"" usually contained within. Every other Xbox, Xbox 360, Xbox One, and One S that I have purchased in a SEALED box contained at least one free month of Xbox Live and sometimes codes to download Demo Games. That is the only thing I could imagine them taking from this box as all the hardware and manuals were present. Overall I am still giving it 4 stars as all I need was a new console. Set-up went as expected and is highly dependent on your internet connection.",3 people found this helpful

Steven C.,2.0 out of 5 stars,Highway robbery,the United States ,August 22 2018,Verified Purchase,  The fact that you can't play a lot of games unless you have Xbox Gold a monthly membership fee after having to pay for a console and the game. This is highway robbery. Example allow you to download fortnite but then you can't play it unless you have this$11 a month membership. This is just wrong they charge you for games and you can't play them online unless you have this stupid membership it's not fair. It's taking advantage of their customers. Even with PlayStation you can play fortnite if you've got a login. So I can play it on my Samsung phone. I can play it on an iPhone. But I can't play it on my Xbox One S unless I pay for an additional membership.,One person found this helpful

WheresMyCoffee,5.0 out of 5 stars,Newcomers to Xbox,the United States ,January 18 2018,Verified Purchase,"  We’ve had this product for a month. Easy set-up (just time consuming), especially when you have to set-up more than one account/controller. We are new to Xbox, so set-up was way easier than learning all the buttons and actually playing a game. If you’re new to Xbox like we were it’s going to take you a while to learn the controller, but most games have tutorials to show you and you’ll learn it in no time. I have an 8yr old and a 6 yr old that learned that way and now they are pros. Speed, updating, downloading, etc. have yet to be a problem. Overall we really enjoy playing games on this console & have no issues.",11 people found this helpful

I bought this xbox to upgrade from my original xbox one but this is no upgrade.

This is probably becuase the games the Xbox is supposed to come with have been removed.

Zero One,1.0 out of 5 stars,Broken Console by an Indifferent Vendor,the United States ,March 18 2018,purchase not verified,"  XBox One S is the worst console I have every owned. Laggy, buggy, prone to crashes due to three clunky OS (master, entertainment, gaming). I performed two full factory resets out of the box, four partial factory resets and it ultimately died during the seventh. I played a single game on it and watched a few movies. Sneeze at it: crash. Look at it: crash. Not to mention it is not the momentous improvement as billed over the original model, let alone my tried and true 360. I never regretted buying a 360. It worked. Sure it sounds like a horror movie lawnmower but that's what TV volume buttons are for, right?The One S ensures that all gaming is a scheduled event. Download the game, even the 360 game an emulator runs, reload it 2x so the install completes. Download all the patches that are required. Five hours later, time to play! ""Sorry, something went wrong."" That's an actual error message.If you don't have immediate problems you can wait for trust Microsoft to mess up an update with bugs. They want your machine on all the time so they can crash it before you can sneeze in the machine's direction. Customer support? Check the forum. Look at the forum. Call customer support! It would be more hilarious if I hadn't wasted nearly $300 and 20+ hours of maintenance time. I have maybe an hour a week to game and this console doesn't allow for pickup and play. Rather, you escape into an ecosystem of ambivalence and frustration, where you are leasing ""beta""-level hardware.

It disnt even last a year. One the headphone jack doesnt work. Two last Thursday when he went to turn on his system it went back to the set up your Xbox one. Got pass the 2 first parts but when it come to updating it said there was something wrong with the update. I tried everything to get it to work for a week end calling Microsoft and they told me he will need to get a new console when he didnt do nothing to it but turn it on and off. I still believe it not the console nor the internet connection especially since my PlayStation ps4 work wonderful with the WiFi. My boyfriend and I are beyond PISS about it because it wasnt even a year before the system apperently wont update.,One person found this helpful
Emily Wallace,1.0 out of 5 stars,Buy a ps4,the United States ,June 19 2019,purchase not verified,"  I don't usually write reviews but I have to for this one. Don't buy an xbox one. Don't buy an xbox one s or any xbox console. I have a Nintendo Wii, ps2, 3ds and all of them are fully functional and still work to this day. (My 3ds takes a beating.) I have had my xbox for one year with 7 games on it and last week I started getting error messages. I called up the help line and the xbox guy literally said my xbox one was trash. They refused to fix it because apparently they don't fix my version of the xbox one anymore. (I'd be way more understanding if I had a faulty xbox360!- I'd be bummed but i wouldn't be warning people away.)So not wanting to waste all the games I bought and needing a system for streaming apps I found an xbox one s in relatively good shape and I bought that. Plus my best friend has an xbox one s (my fault) so I'm trapped until next gen.Right at this moment I can't even sign into my account due to actual xbox live issues. It has been an hour.My boyfriend has a ps4 and uses it SO much more than I use my system, and has NONE of these issues. None. This boy never even shuts his ps4 down the safe way.Don't make the same mistake I did. My ps2 still works and that should have been the life experience I needed to stick with ps consoles. Just buy a ps4. Don't risk such a huge investment in a system that has these issues.",0 people found this helpful
Taylor,1.0 out of 5 stars,OMG,the United States ,October 29 2019,purchase not verified,"  Xbox One is the worst console I have ever owned. Through my life I have owned PS1, PS2, PS3, 64, GameCube, Wii, Xbox 360 and now this literal piece of garbage. This system is so bad that I was highly considering donating it, but then I realized that I would be the jerk that ruined that poor kids life. This being the latest Xbox out to date, is a joke. Whenever I attempt to play (which 50% of the time I cannot because something has to update or the game has to download for 5hours), I feel like I have jumped back to year 1950. How could this system be so bad? How could every other system that I have owned be faster and more efficient than the “NEWEST” Xbox. When I mentioned that you have to download your game onto Xbox for 5 hours - I was not being sarcastic. I buy a disc, and cannot not play it immediately because the game has to install onto the system. Why does it do this? Because even with it being installed (which literally has taken over 5 hours before for COD Modern Warfare), YOU STILL NEED TO INSERT THE DISC TO PLAY THE GAME. Save yourself, and don’t waste hours of your life on this.",0 people found this helpful
Kyle Ebel,4.0 out of 5 stars,Efficient and Easy on the Wallet,the United States ,February 17 2019,purchase not verified,"  The Xbox 1S is a good console if your looking for an upgrade for the Xbox 1, but don’t have a lot of money. This would be great for Parents and College students who might want to buy an Xbox, for multiple of purposes. It can also be used for beginner streamers. It gives you a good base to start with and comes with good games like Gears of War, Halo series, Cup Heads, etc.Somethings that you might want to know+Is always on, even when you have it off.+I had one incident of miss coloring, but a hard reset fixed it.+It is very customizable, and have a bunch of options for you to mess with.+The voice activation function is very annoying, can turn it off.+No more energy box, just the power cordYou can use twitch, but Xbox has bought it’s own streaming site.If you like Xbox, but just can’t afford the Xbox X this is for you. It has good graphics, and comes with all the things you need to connect it with a TV with an hdmi cable. As like every xbox it can be a good dvd player, netflix device and a casual gaming console. If you are looking for streaming or recording purposes, the console comes with a built in system giving you the ability to stream, and also it comes with inputs in order to capture content. The Xbox 1s comes with 1080p streaming capabilities, you just need the Internet to support it.  I recommend it to anyone looking into this.",0 people found this helpful

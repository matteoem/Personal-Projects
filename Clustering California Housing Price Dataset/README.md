Here is reported the clustering study I conducted on the California Housing Price.  
Since unsupervised learning is a difficult task, this homework from the Data Mining course of my MSc in AI & Robotics was aiming to challenge each one of us to see how far we could get with a clustering task on a dataset that is not meant to be.
I implemented two different clustering parts: one on raw data, and one on engineered data, to show how feature engineering is key for good results in information extraction through clustering.

Since the results are quite a lot, I have loaded on this folder the report I did for my assignment. The second exercise is the one you have to look for in order to read. I will report only the results here since I think they are quite formidable:

Two of the three clusters seems
to be distributed on the richest places of the California, which are los Angeles,
San Diego,and so on.
Doing some research on the internet, a map of the california about tax revenue
per resident was found,and it is displayed on the next page. In the next pages
are reported also the feature distributions for each cluster

From the distribution of each feature in each cluster we noticed how the map of tax revenue seems to be very similar in distribution to the clusterization that we obtained, which is
promising. Although the poorest cluster and the wealthiest cluster seems to
be overllapped on the coast, this could be interpreted as high social inequality(
” Economic inequality in Los Angeles is driven by an expanding population
at the bottom of the income and wealth distributions together with a growing
share held by those at the top”.  [Source](https://knowledge.luskin.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Haynes-Report_WideningDivide_Ong_UCLA_1.3.2017.pdf)

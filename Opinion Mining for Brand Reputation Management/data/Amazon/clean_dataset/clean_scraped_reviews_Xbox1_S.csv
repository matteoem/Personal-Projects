JD,1,THIS UNIT IS USED!!!!! Not new !,the United States ,20180818,True,"  I’d give zero stars if I could.  Buyer Beware.  This is a used unit, and mine didn’t even work properly.  The disc drive didn’t work, so I contacted Microsoft onkhbrk find out my warranty expires in 5 months instead of a year.  So in other words this is a used unit not new!  So I’m sending it back without the box since I threw that out a week ago.  I was only playing downloaded games and today decided to put in a disc.  Low and behold the used Xbox didn’t work.  Getting a refund",218,english
Daniella,1,Such a disappointment! Didn’t even work!,the United States ,20181127,True,"  If I could give this product zero stars, I would. It didn’t even arrive at my house, I had to pick it up from some quick mart liquor store. Then once I opened it and set everything up, IT DIDNT EVEN TURN ON! I tried everything to fix the problem. Using a different outlet, waiting a while to restart it, using a different cord. Nothing worked so I took it to my friend who fixes electronics and he said it’s nonrepairable. The only that worked was the remote controller which I gave to my brother and the game it came with.",121,english
dewyer p,1,Beware. It could be used,the United States ,20181127,True,  This was a used console. I was very disappointed. I was expecting a new one.,112,english
Kenny Hobson,5,Xbox Is Awesome,the United States ,20171014,True,  Had some delivery issues but yeah It arrived in the box unopened as should. I replaced my big bulky black Xbox One Day One Edition with this. And let me just say this thing feels way more then 40% smaller! It looks like more then 50% smaller! This will be my new xbox pretty much forever unless they release another one after the Xbox One X.,126,english
Alexis Brennan,5,Must buy,the United States ,20180905,True,"  Slimmer design than Xbox one, button to turn on is actual button so u don’t accidentally turn it off, controller has aux jack for headphones, uses same rechargeable batteries as originial Xbox one, and the controller has a different textured grip, USB jack in front for easy access for rechargeable wire, it’s 1TB so you’ll never run out of space, came with month free of Xbox live and free game pass, Great console for great price",49,english
kris suitos,5,Seller is amazing....would buy from him again,the United States ,20180427,True,"  My son got his first job and wanted to buy himself something. He ordered this. When the unit came the controller had a rattling noise and the cord to the unit fit loosely.  My son set up the unit and everything else seemed to work ok. The seller immediately sent me an email once the item was ordered letting me know that if there are any issues to please contact him immediately.  Since it was not something I used on a daily basis I kept forgetting to ask my son if everything was working properly. The seller followed up with another email and I finally asked my son if everything was good with his purchase.  My son repeated to me that the controller was not the best and the power cord was loose and he had to keep fixing it. I emailed the seller who immediately sent a new controller. Still waiting on the power cord, but I would purchase from this seller anytime. He is big on customer service and selling a good quality product. I greatly appreciated the email follow up to ensure that we were happy with the purchase we had made. My son was so happy to have a controller that worked properly.",68,english
M. Koller,4,Bit of a glitchy model.,the United States ,20180830,True,"  Shipment was very quick. However, when I pulled it out of the box and began setting it up, I did notice that the supplied hard drive has a few problems. Applications hang at times, and games saved to the hard drive have occasionally crashed requiring a return to the Home screen or a full restart of the console. It could just be my model, but it is a disappointment for a machine that is supposed to be incredibly powerful based on the hardware it comes with.",34,english
THOUVY,5,Family time!,the United States ,20180315,True,  arived brand new. Great packaging! Very happy!,31,english
Fabian M.,4,USED/REFURBISHED,the United States ,20190427,True,"  The Xbox one I received was very well packaged, although finding out these units are used the hard way was a big hit in the gut. I wish the seller was honest and mentioned it was refurbished. Other than very minor scuff(s) and the entrance to the power cord was off it's axis from inside the Xbox by like 3cm and made  me have to use more force to install a simple power cord and only Because it's off by those 3cm. In other words this unit of mine particularly the one I got. May have been (opened) for repairs. Warranty sticker is still intact. But from my expiereice those are easy to remove and Put on again other than that perfmance is great runs all my games connects toy WiFi with no issues. Comes with 1 controller no game. Reason for 4 stars is because I wish the seller was more honest and TOLD us the customer these are used units.",6,english
Xylem,5,Great Buy!,the United States ,20190303,True,"  The price on this Xbox One was great. I saw some of the reviews that said the unit that they received was used, and I was a bit worried. However, mine appeared to be new and packaged in the original packing with no sign of it having been used or refurbished. I have only used it for a few days, but so far, it is working perfectly and I couldn't be happier.",9,english
Lonely Neuron,3,"Working well now, but...",the United States ,20181008,True,"  The console/controller and a 2nd controller ordered separately arrived promptly, but had two problems (one real and one perceived). The perceived problem was that the power cord could not be securely plugged into the back of the console. After a 30-minute drive to the local Microsoft store, it was demonstrated that if one pushed very (and I mean *very*) hard the plug would insert securely. The other problem was that the controller that came with the console would randomly fail to operate - becoming inoperative after anywhere from a minute to an hour (the separately ordered 2nd controller operated flawlessly). The Microsoft store gladly swapped my defective controller for a new one (though I had to accept a black one rather than white). The new controller is working perfectly.",6,english
L. Christenson,1,"If Buying for Christmas, Know that You only have a 30 Day Return Window.",the United States ,20181107,True,"  I am trying to complete my Christmas shopping early but learned upon receiving the item that I only have a 30 day return window.  So if the item does not work on Christmas day, I won't be able to return it which will disappoint me and my kids.  I believe this return window should be clearly stated up front.",10,english
Gordon,5,Xbox One for 200$,the United States ,20190621,True,"  Made sure i got the one with a bluray and not the one without a cdrom. Basically i use this as my Hulu/Prime video machine i'm not a console gamer but my fire stick starting to lag and lock up so i wanted more power. Looking at the Nvidia Shield which is close in price and does less so Xbox One is a no brainer for TV box over other options out there. Not going to knock a star off but just like Siri i am not a fan of Cortana either Google is just leagues above these two speach apps when it comes to understanding what you're saying to it. Alexa is pretty good too. PDP Talon Media Remote Control for Xbox One, TV, Blu-ray & Streaming Media. Get that remote",2,english
Amber W.,2,FALSE ADVERTISEMENT,the United States ,20190407,True,"  So, on the side of the xbox box, there is a list of what all comes with the system. Mine said that there was a free month of xbox game pass but there wasnt any papers other than a manual and the warranty information. When the xbox was all set-up, I got a notification where I could sign up for a month for $1, but that isn't FREE. Normally amazon is pretty spot on with the descriptions of their products, but I will never buy a system like this on amazon again. Also, where is all the paperwork you get with a new system? And the year this system was brought out wasn't 2017 like it says, its actually 2016.",4,english
Micah Kiter,1,"Used product, warranty out of date, not what was advertised",the United States ,20190530,True,"  This is NOT a new product.  Box was re-taped with circular tape but not lined up with previous seal.  Different colored controller received.. warranty expired with Microsoft.  Save yourself the headache and whatifs, spend the extra 40 bucks and buy straight from Microsoft.  This seller is a sheister.",6,english
EVIII,4,Good merchant Terrible platform,the United States ,20190924,True,"  Had nothing but a good experience from the merchant who sold this.Xbox as a platform is terrible though. Xbox has long been the multiplayer focused platform yet because of design flaws in the system and its always on (but we pretend like its not) requirement when instances of big games being released (like the recent Gears 5) or general server outages it renders the console useless if you cannot ""call home"" to verify your fealty to Microsoft. You have to have already put your machine into offline mode in order to have avoided this which is mostly impossible to predict when it will happen and is simply not possible after the fact of a server outage. Whats worse is you virtually MUST keep it online.Further the system is built around digital distribution from the ground up.  Focus on multiplayer games to sell Xbox live, Games with gold and their psuedo netflix style Game Pass service offer the promise of delivering you games. Yet you own nothing. You only get privilege to access these things so long as you have paid your tithe to Microsoft. Stop paying your subscription fees and those ""free"" games you were given with gold are locked out and inaccessible to you until you DO pay. That keeps you paying, and agreeing to waive more and more of your legal rights each time they feel compelled to take more from you, which 95% of gamers have no clue what they are taking because they just blindly scroll through the terms and conditions just to get to the agree box.Then their gamepass service IS COMPLETELY online required. Despite having a game installed and a valid subscription to it, AND the capacity to run clocks underneath the software that will know when to cut off your access once your subscription cuts off despite not having a connection, you cannot access ANY game pass games offline in any capacity.Everybody talks about it does not have games. That obviously is not true. It has most the same games you would get on PS4 and to a lesser extent Switch. The games where it lacks is exclusives, but technically that is not true. It does have some exclusives, but like with everything else with the console they are hidden and locked away behind digital distribution. When you count how many physical exclusives they have you can just about count them on two hands.The Xbox embodies all the worst traits of gaming this generation. Pointless style over substance (as seen between standard and X model of console that has next to no justification to exist because no games fully utilize its added horsepower)  Demanding you swear fealty and give your rights away in perpetuity, trading money for nothing but revocable licenses, forced online need, focus on multiplayer digital sport type experiences instead of on video games, everything about the platform is bad. Its taking the worst practices in the industry and distilling them to an anti consumer driven digital sports focused machine that is more than happy to take your money but expects you to keep handing it over after any transaction has been completed.While the PS4 (PRO ONLY) and Switch have some similar elements, Microsofts anti consumer products are the only field where they are actually innovating. So do not make the mistake I made and hurt the industry by buying this garbage.I give the merchant 5/5 and Microsoft NEGATIVE 5 out of 5 because it should not even exist in this state, to the point that one day in the future it will require legislation to fix the things they are trying to do with this and future incarnations of the Xbox platform.",1,english
ramon2585,5,I was skeptical but...,the United States ,20190116,True,"  I didn't want to buy it because it said Discontinued, but that wasn't a problem at all. I've been using it daily since December 12 when it was delivered and I haven't had any problems. It came in the original box it's sold in. I included the picture. I was just on it a half hour ago playing Overwatch.",5,english
HCJr,5,I have nothing bad to say,the United States ,20180710,True,  It's an Xbox. I have nothing bad to say.,7,english
LesGamer148,5,I always wanted to have this...,the United States ,20190620,True,"  Because I always wanted to have X1 and PS4 when it was first announced in 2013. Unfortunately, it was $500 before and... I’m glad that I didn’t waste thousand dollars from getting it in the first place. Since it took years and now on my 27th birthday (which it has already passed last week), it comes in mail unexpectedly right on time Anyways, so far from my X1 console review. Before and after unboxing... it looks clean and brand new from complete X1 game system itself but unfortunately, I only have one small problem with a battery included controller but... that’s not suppose to be a big deal at all cause I could always get complete battery kit set for the controller itself, no worries from that. Anyways, the game system itself really works and that’s all it matters to me  Looking forward to re-buy again from a same seller, 5/5 ",2,english
BrokeShopaholic,5,Son loves it!,the United States ,20190405,True,"  Made a deal with my son and told him he can have his own Xbox (we shared before) so of course he’s done everything I’ve asked of him to and this was cheap enough for a “discontinued” model. He loves it and he’s a pretty happy kid. Definitely recommend, no issues with ours and it was shipped the first of April and got it literally the next day without even paying for that kind of shipping so that was a pleasant surprise!",3,english
Zak,5,Pleasantly Surprised!,the United States ,20190709,True,"  For years my wife and I shared the original Xbox One, and with most of the new games being online co-op only we knew we needed to make a change. So here we are looking for a reasonably priced new Xbox, knowing that a new version will be coming out in 2020. Leave it to Amazon to have amazing deals on brand new (still boxed in original packaging) Xboxes!So glad we purchased the Xbox One S! It is significantly smaller than the original Xbox One, and doesn't even need a charging brick!! Talk about updates. Everything was in brand new original packaging and arrived quickly and in great condition. Got the Xbox set up and running the day it arrived, and have been using it everyday since. It's very quiet and has fast response times. My wife already had an Xbox sport controller, so we haven't used the controller that comes with it yet. But it looks great upon arrival and did come with batteries (extra plus, because we don't keep a lot of those lying around).TL;DR we were hesitant about purchasing from Amazon because of the bad reviews, but SO GLAD we did, because our experience was great. Plus, Amazon has a top notch return policy.",1,english
Edward,3,Not worth the price.,the United States ,20200730,True,  So for the price it’s not worth it. The Xbox X comes out in less than 6 months. This Xbox is looks good and definitely doesn’t lag like my previous Xbox One. I can’t notice any visual difference in game play. In fairness I don’t have a fancy TV but I don’t have a hi-def TV. The controller feels slightly lose. On my Overwatch game the left analog stick drifts right. I would return this item but I’m afraid the process would be too complicated. I’m ok with the mini stalls when turning this Xbox on. I’m hoping I don’t have any major issues before three years. So to recap I have owned three Xbox’s. I like them but this one has got stuck loading twice in three weeks. The controller drifts and feels like the assembly of it is slightly loose. Lastly I don’t think the value is worth it. The speed is better than the Xbox One but that’s the only difference and it’s only a little faster. The Xbox X is coming out soon and not much more. I suggest waiting till it comes out to upgrade.,0,english
Jacob,3,Best of the current gen consoles. Currently.,the United States ,20190718,True,  ****Edit 2-21-2020***I'm on the verge of leaving gaming entirely. As an adult with a full time job. I have sporadic instances to play videogames. The frustration is this: Everytime I boot up my system bam! Update! Then next time bam! Update! Update! The system the games! Maybe 1/5 times I boot up my system it's ready to play the game I intended to play! WHATS THE POINT OF NEXT GEN EXPERIENCES IF I NEVER GET TO PLAY IT!!! This is not the gaming I grew up loving. I've grown to rue current consoles. It's only getting worse!I own all the current gen consoles. After a lil use I can say honestly the Xbox One in its current state is the best overall. The best game selection. The best online marketplace. The best disc drive capabilities (4k). Personally the controller is nice. No silly frills...The UI is probably the weakest link. It functions fine but the blocky Windows phone design is unappealing.Things that would improve this Xbox. Multiple color options (white is boring). Included vertical standing option. Silly to have to buy something extra for a simple purpose. Better UI design. A sleep mode like PS has.,0,english
Davey,5,Can play partial 4k games and most 4k movies,the United States ,20180410,True,  Works well and plays alot of games and 4k movies,6,english

Brad Portzer,4,"Open box, not new, but appears unused",the United States ,20190922,True,"  So this specifically pertains to the Xbox One S(New) purchased from Worldwide Distributors. The product arrived in good condition and if it wasn't for reading other reviews I probably wouldn't have noticed anything was off.  The Xbox itself and included accessories appear unused and in factory condition. The issues are that the seals were doubled over, the included trial codes were missing, and the warranty only has 7 months left on a year warranty. What I assume occurs is they purchase the product themselves which activates the warranty, they remove the trial codes to sell them elsewhere and reseal the product so the average consumer would never notice the difference. This to me isn't a dealbreaker, I still got a seemingly unused xbox for a decent price, but I know for others this is a big issue. Now, if the product ends up defective or fails in the next few months because its actually used, thats another issue, and I will return to update this review.",1,english
David ,5,game on easy,the United States ,20180622,True,"  great price, great shipping, my son loves it, easy to install, comes with everything you need, buy it",8,english
Tracy,5,Best purchase,the United States ,20190805,True,"  I've now had this product for a year, and I'm so happy I purchased it. The value is great, and the storage space for the price is what pushed me to finally buy it. I've never had any problems with it, and I love it to death.Buying an Xbox introduced me to incredibly beautiful and fun games I'd never heard of, like Warframe, and gaming online brought me closer to people and I've really enjoyed my time with it.I'll always be grateful for this purchase because it let me meet my best friend and love of my life. 10/10",1,english
Amazon Customer,1,Used device,the United States ,20200216,True,"  Well I did purchase a new console to surprise my children during the winter vacation but we were very disappointed to get a used device .. unfortunately I got a used XBOX!! The box was not sealed , in fact there were 3 layers of old tape ..box is in bad condition, and there is missing things , yes you hear it ! Game pass was  taken out of the box and I think there was another part missing which is the vertical stand ..very disappointed with my purchase waiting for the Weekend to pass to call for return or replacement...I’ll make an update to my review  if anything changes after I call them..as now I don’t recommend buying from them. It was my fault I ignored all the previous reviews from unsatisfied costumers.",1,english
Amazon Customer,2,Controller broke stopped working properly after two days,the United States ,20180915,True,"  Console worked perfectly fine, but the controller would not sync up with the console at all well right out of the box. It would sysc/ un Sync during play. We have another Xbox one with controller that synced perfectly fine to this new console. So it was the new controller that was no good. We used a USB adaptor to connect the ""wireless controller"" and that worked for a few days, but now it stopped syncing all together. It looked brand new but it must have been defective. Buy at your own risk!",3,english
JimBob728,1,Worst purchase I have ever made at Amazon,the United States ,20200316,True,"  These X Boxes are flimsy and cheaply made.  Drop the controller, (even on a carpeted floor) and it’s done.  I purchased this for my grandson’s birthday.  Setting up was easy, but fun ended there.  My grandson and I spent over 4 hours trying to get games to play. WHY do things have to be so incredibly complicated?  Why can you not insert a game disc and play......period?  My grandson, who is a whiz at learning and playing electronic stuff, just gave up and almost in tears lost interest.  I returned this system today for a refund.  Microsoft......stick to computers and get out of the gaming business.  Buying this was a BIG mistake, hope you don’t make the same one.",0,english
Nick,3,It works fine but was NOT new,the United States ,20191007,True,"  Replacing a Day One Edition Xbox 1 that crapped out with this.  The listing states the item was new, but it was not new.  The box had been resealed as evident by cut stickers and residue on the packaging.  Also, when I signed in to register the unit, the warranty had  already started about 4-5 months prior.  It works fine, but the listing was wrong and Amazon should review the seller.",2,english
Alan,1,Thought this would be an upgrade to my 360.  It is not.,the United States ,20200504,True,  This console was an absolute let-down.  It is slow and this concept of diskless gaming is awful.  If you want to new game it must be downloaded and given that any game for this system is 40-100gb it takes forever.  If you have slower internet expect a game to take several days or weeks to download.  Graphics are not noticeably better than those of the 360 and everything else is worse.  After just two months the controller fails to connect to the console.  I am never buying an Xbox again.  Stick to your 360 if you're thinking of buying this.,0,english
Lukas Mullins,3,Very disappointed,the United States ,20190507,True,"  Ok so to get it straight the Xbox itself is great, I haven't had any issues with it what so over. BUT the headset Jack in the controller stopped working after less then 2 months of use. Know that I am not rough with ANY of my electronics. I wanted to get it refunded but the return window had closed by then so now I am going to have to go spend another $50 on a controller. not happy about this and very disappointed in Microsoft.",2,english
Cipero,5,"Quick delivery, perfect condition",the United States ,20190617,True,  First and foremost I have my fair share of complaints with Microsoft however I own both ps4 pro and this will be my third Xbox haha but the thing that keeps me wanting to have an Xbox is unfortunately when you’ve played as long as I have that’s just where the friends I’ve made along the way are. You should know by now which games you want to play and where the people you’ll play with will be. This version of the Xbox is what you want if you are not going the full measure to get the one x.That being said the five stars are for my experience with the seller. I purchased the product and it was at my door the next day. Perfect condition. No complaints whatsoever.,0,english
Kevin,2,Disappointed but it works,the United States ,20210118,True,"  I knew this was used when I bought it so I was not expecting a flawless Xbox. I was, however expecting it to be clean, free of dust and finger prints. Which it was not. I was also expecting a controller that was in decent shape. But the controller I got has 4 buttons that stick, making it almost impossible to play any type of racing game, as the throttle always gets stuck.  It looked as if whoever sold this pulled it right out of their living room, wrapped it in bubble wrap then put it in a box and shipped it. It was not clean, There were 6 user profiles still on it. Almost half the space was full with games I could not play. Which I had to uninstall myself. I was not expecting that. I even had to blow the dust out of the console.  I will say, on the plus side it arrived a day earlier than it was scheduled to. Also a plus is that I have had no issues with the console itself.(Other than dirty and half full) It seems to work fine. I would have given this a much higher rating had the seller taken the time to clean it and included a controller that didn't stick.",0,english
P. Cahill,3,NOT BRAND NEW!!!,the United States ,20190403,True,  the box had all three security tabs broken on the bottom side. all top ones were intact. Registered serial number with Microsoft and the 1 year warranty is set to expire in two months.,2,english
Ryan Tanis,5,Great graphics not a great 4K blu ray player,the United States ,20200329,True,"  Wanted great graphics without buying a thousand dollar gaming pc. This thing has great graphics, obviously better than my wii console, and I can use the controllers on my old steam pc games. Compared to my Blu-ray player The Xbox plays 4K Blu-ray’s, Blu-ray’s and DVD’s super dark. I don’t know if I had bought a dedicated 4K Blu-ray player it would be different but just my experience with the 4K player off the xbox",0,english

Andre,5,Perfect,the United States ,20190227,True,"  Awhile back I had to get rid of my previous Xbox One S and I saved up to get another and purchased it from this place. It came with the controller, the console, power cable, and an HDMI cable as well as a 14 day free Xbox Live Gold trial and 1 Month of Game Pass. I was worried that this would just be the console but it was much more than that and I am very satisfied to have an Xbox One S again.",1,english
Julie,5,Exactly as described-very good!,the United States ,20201225,True,  Christmas morning - seems to be working well so far. My son had to update the controller and is currently downloading games.It arrived on time and in good condition. I’m relieved that everything seems to be in order. Grateful for the seller having exactly what I needed to make a second “fair” Xbox set up for my twins who want to play with friends and each other at the same time. I wanted a refurbished product - not one newer than the other. Perfect.,0,english
Matthew S.,1,Not New!,the United States ,20191224,True,  I ordered this as a Christmas gift on December 16th with Prime 2 day shipping and it wasn't until the 23rd when it finally shipped. It showed up Christmas Eve and when I opened the box I saw the original seals from the factory had been cut and covered with new ones. Do not buy one of these consoles that are about this price point as they all seem to be used. This should be illegal to send a used console when I pay for a new one. Now I can't even send it back and get a new one before Christmas!,0,english
Amazon Customer,5,Great Buy!,the United States ,20200120,True,"  Your browser does not support HTML5 video.   Xbox is great! I have been playing it for about 4 days now. I know that doesn't seem like a long time, but it has been working very smoothly. Everything is new - it comes with batteries, remote, console and power cord, and HDMI cord.I was a little skeptical about the item upon arrival because when I opened the Amazon box I saw that the Xbox box was retaped but everything inside the box looked new and was wrapped with original wrapping.I recommend the console. The price is affordable and the system is real and quality. The same Xbox you'll buy new from Best Buy or GameStop except they have it for a higher price. Buy it, you'll enjoy it!Any problems you can always contact the seller or Microsoft.*Headphones did not come with the order - that is a separate order.",0,english
N. Lee,5,Best all-in-one console,the United States ,20190718,True,"  In addition to having the best selection of games on the market, the Xbox seems to be the best entertainment system out there. It is my go-to for playing games, listening to music, browsing YouTube or using a variety of video streaming services. The price is also so reasonable that I picked up a second one to have its features available in multiple rooms.",1,english
Bob W Rosseter,5,More bang for your buck if looking for a 4k blue ray player,the United States ,20200608,True,  Was looking to purchase a 4k blue ray player. Xbox one s gives me both a 4k player for movies and a long overdue upgrade from my xbox 360. Looks great black and white. I use my Samsung tv remote to control player for movie menus. Satisfied with purchase. Local Walmart had one for far less a few weeks after my online  purchase but sells fast. Be careful of price gauging. My purchase price was reasonable.,1,english

Kahos923,5,Easy setup,the United States ,20200618,True,"  Setup was super easy, I don’t have any issues with the console so far. My controller gets disconnected pretty easily but I don’t know if that’s a regular xBox thing or not. Storage is pretty good, I haven’t had any issues with that. The machine works quickly and works well with Alexa on my Dot. I think it was worth the money I paid for it. It came brand new.",0,english
Daniel,1,Total Junk,the United States ,20201104,True,  Got it from Ravenholm electronics and they screwed me. Didn't even send me what they had a picture of and not even close to the description.

dustin medina,1,"Open box, game pass missing",the United States ,20191008,True,  Seller opened the box and stole the game pass that is supposed to come with the console.

I feel like it's only a matter of time before it needs to be sent back again. Definitely the last time I purchase an XBox system.,1,english
Raphael Cadiz,1,SCAM. READ REVIEWS!!,the United States ,20191005,True,"  Listen very closely, every good review is either someone from the company or a buyer who hasn’t had the system for longer than a week. This is a scam. The systems are used and damaged. Many only repaired long enough to function for a week. Read all the 1 star reviews. The disc reader won’t work, the remote will be broken, it will glitch. Mine started to defect 24 HOURS! after unboxing. READ THE 1 STAR REVIEWS THEY ARE THE TRUTH.",1,english
Michael McC,4,I resent having to add a headline.,the United States ,20190711,True,"  I resent having to set up my ""account"" (email, password, phone, ad nauseum) before I could even play agame from a disk. I don't recall seeing anything about this in any advertising and feel that this really amounts to changing the agreement of sale after the fact. (Criticism directed at Microsoft) The product was delivered quickly at a good price.",1,english
Captainkillbot,1,Very slow to react and download is taking forever with good speed,the United States ,20200219,True,"  Your browser does not support HTML5 video.   It's very slow, my intent is to replace my original xboxone as it's very old but this new one has been downloading a single game all day long. I know the game is big but my old xbox only took 4 hours and this guy has been at it almost 18 hours now. I'm not sure if I want to return it or give it another shot, even the menus load considerably slower I did read a few bad reviews but there were enough good ones to convince me it would be a good buy.",0,english
neal p cozzens,5,Broken controller replaced,the United States ,20201227,True,  Exelent customer service! Received with broken controller so threw it out and bought a new one at local retail store.

Leonard Olson,1,"Controller microphone not working properly. Bought another controller, same issue after two weeks..",the United States ,20190510,True,"  The delivery went perfect. No issues there.This review is on the the XBox. It is not working properly. I have two controllers (I purchased the 2nd separately) and two headsets. There is no sound on the headsets when hooked up to the controllers. They worked for a period of time then suddenly stopped. At different times. This is only on XBox.The headsets still work perfectly on PS4. I purchased this due to friends playing online on XBox. Sending them PS4's, determined it would be cheaper than to keep buying controllers.",1,english
Christian Hair,5,I couldn’t be happier,the United States ,20191015,True,"  I was worried about buying a used, not to mention discontinued, Xbox One S online, but the price was unbeatable. So I went ahead and bought it. It got here earlier than they said it would, which is great. The cardboard shipping box it came in was pretty beaten up, as was the actual Xbox Box, but the Xbox itself was pristine. I can’t believe it was used. It came with the controller, batteries (To my pleasant surprise), power cord, and HDMI cable. I set everything up to make sure it worked okay and everything was perfect. So happy with this purchase. I’ll update this review if I notice any flaws later down the road, but as for right now, I’m so so happy.",0,english
Max Gesford,4,Late/No arrival,the United States ,20191204,True,"  I've always loved the xbox franchise and with that being said the xbox one is no exception. However, I'd purchased a system for myself after wanting one for years and I caved and bought one on November 24th. It had not moved from its location in a California distribution center and had not gone any further till November 30th when it finally hit Pittsburgh PA. Now, it was scheduled to arrive on November 30 and I do understand that it was a holiday weekend and the weather conditions were terrible and as so I've been patiently waiting. But it has been over a week and it has barely progressed. And for a regular Amazon user, it is kind of disappointing. Still awaiting arrival",0,english
Amazon Customer,1,BUYERS BEWARE!!!,the United States ,20200206,True,"  looked sharp and brand new right out of box but once it loaded up the clutching started.  Could not access any options or sign in screens, screen would flash for a second then go away.  Couldn't access settings to even try a factory reset very disappointing.  Packed right up and signed up for replacement but after seeing some of these other reviews I might just do refund.  I'll talk to Amazon and go from there.",1,english

I returned it, and received a new one very fast!",0,english
ride,1,"A damaged, returned item",the United States ,20190707,True,"  On delivery, seals were broken, controller was scratched up, and warranty was 8/12 months gone. Not a new item. Not even “like-new”. Back it goes.",1,english
Dorothy Sanders,1,"It's alright, Stick To Sony.",the United States ,20190717,True,"  I love my XBox but when I received it the controller would connect and cut on the xbox. Then it'd stop connecting. With every 15 seconds, give or take, it'd stop connecting. I called amazon, they called Microsoft, Microsoft told me it was the controller, so send back the xbox for a new one. Why not just send a controller. That'd be amazing.",1,english
Meg,1,FALSE ADVERTISING! SCAM ALERT!,the United States ,20200124,True,"  BUYER BEWARE this Xbox is advertised as a 1tb console but when it was delivered and I looked into the storage myself I saw that it is actually only a 500gb console. Now it's too late for me to return the product, so I got ripped off. Shame on this seller. I wish I would have read other reviews before I wasted my hard-earned money!",0,english
Joseph G.,1,NOT new!,the United States ,20190427,True,"  The reviews were pretty mixed, but there were multiple people who asked in the FAQs if this was a brand new unit. It was confirmed more than once that it was. It wasn’t. I have pictures. The controller loses connection every time. I’ve looked up all the fixes, but nothing helps. I’ll be returning the unit. As usual, can’t leave zero stars, so it gets one.",2,english
Kati,2,Be careful before you buy,the United States ,20190711,True,"  My unit makes a super load noise all the time if the console is on. Even if I'm just watch in my something, it's incredibly annoying and I can't find out how to fix it. I am probably going to return it and get a new one. Other than that though, the xbox is great... but I find myself using it less than I want to because the sound is so dang annoying.",1,english
Amazon Customer,1,Don’t do it,the United States ,20200301,True,  It was horrible. If i could rate this 0 stars i would. The description said it comes with a controller. We didn’t get one. Then we get a receipt inside saying the Xbox was 80 when we paid almost 200. Amazon did NOTHING to help but say “you have to take to the retailer. So we did we reached out and the man claims everything otherwise even though it didn’t meet the description. 1 week later into gameplay the Xbox glitches all the time. It struggles playing games and it’s extremely inconvenient and a waste of money. Shame on the retailer for overcharging for garbage.,0,english
Ariel,4,Satisfied,the United States ,20200125,True,  Am glad to have gotten this before they were discontinued for good. I prefer a disc insert to the one without. Gives me an option to buy the actualGame used rather than having to buy it new at full price and download it on my console. Have always loved Xbox though so of course I’m happy with it!,0,english
Chris Locke,5,Value,the United States ,20181111,True,  Kids love it in fact they are playing Minecraft on it almost a year later. We use it as a DVD /Blu-ray player and it gets plenty of use. The box was a bit damaged when we got it but it seems to be unharmed.,1,english

Ladd Sustar,1,Not as described,the United States ,20200801,True,"  This Xbox is not new as advertised. The Xbox is advertised as NEW, ""Buy New"" is marked so I expected a new item. When I received this item the box seals are broken, no 1-month Xbox Game Pass trial, and 1-month of Xbox Live Gold was in the box. This appears to be a refurbished item not a new item. I did not receive what I was led to believe based on description.",0,english

David Gardner,1,Died 2 months after purchase,the United States ,20200229,True,"  The console died after 2 months of usage, stopped suddenly and won't turn on anymore. It didn't even overheat and none of the troubleshooting from Microsoft worked. The product is also out of warranty according to Microsoft while it should be under warranty for a year, which makes me think it is not a new product, most likely refurbished. Amazon can't do anything about it because the purchase was more than 30 days ago. The listing is misleading as it should be specified that it is not a new product.",0,english

Carly Pizarro,3,wasnt satisfied,the United States ,20190502,True,"  I'm leaving a 3 star because the console came clearly used/refurbished not NEW like advertised. Has major scuff on top of console hugley visible under light, and the black plastic bottom of the console seems to be pried off the console frame in the front left corner but still somehow sturdy, the usb connection still worked fine, and I've played one digital game via download through Ethernet which worked fine and played a blue ray disc all the way through. Overall worked fine but had major blemish/ cosmetic damage. Wasn't satisfied",1,english

For $200 its a great deal. All in all I spent $400 on everything that was with a 1080p 22inch tv the one s red dead 2 and halo 5.

David W.,5,Worth the Price,the United States ,20191213,True,"  I preferred to pass on the ""all digital"" version with no disk drive because I had many Xbox 360 games I still enjoyed.

My Xbox 360 is gone now but considering the many years I got out of it, I'm very confident that my new Xbox One S is equally built to last.",0,english
V Money,5,Excellent entertainment hub,the United States ,20190612,True,"  Funny thing is the greatest part about this piece of hardware is the software associated with it, from the xBox itself and from the Amazon Alexa integration.

D,1,"Box was tampered with, will return",the United States ,20190207,True,"  The box had 2 sets of stickers, which means it was opened and another sticker was put on. I requested a new Xbox and that wasn’t new so I returned it.",3,english

Should be advertised as used the proce is a bit high for a used system but. All in all. great product. Timely shipping. And its basically new. No scuffs or markings. My system was in spainish.

It blends in well with my rather small media setup, is slightly faster than my previous Xbox, has more storage, and was at a more affordable price range! I have SEVERAL complaints about the seller labeling this as ""New"", even though the tape had been opened, the vertical stand was nowhere to be seen, and the codes for Live Gold and Game Pass were missing.

All components were present and in working order though. As I have purchased various other Microsoft gaming systems over the years, I can only assume that the package was opened by the original seller in order to remove the ""Freebies"" usually contained within. Every other Xbox, Xbox 360, Xbox One, and One S that I have purchased in a SEALED box contained at least one free month of Xbox Live and sometimes codes to download Demo Games. That is the only thing I could imagine them taking from this box as all the hardware and manuals were present. Overall I am still giving it 4 stars as all I need was a new console. Set-up went as expected and is highly dependent on your internet connection.",3,english

Steven C.,2,Highway robbery,the United States ,20180822,True,  The fact that you can't play a lot of games unless you have Xbox Gold a monthly membership fee after having to pay for a console and the game.

This is just wrong they charge you for games and you can't play them online unless you have this stupid membership it's not fair. It's taking advantage of their customers. Even with PlayStation you can play fortnite if you've got a login. So I can play it on my Samsung phone. I can play it on an iPhone.

WheresMyCoffee,5,Newcomers to Xbox,the United States ,20180118,True,"  We’ve had this product for a month. Easy set-up (just time consuming), especially when you have to set-up more than one account/controller. We are new to Xbox, so set-up was way easier than learning all the buttons and actually playing a game. If you’re new to Xbox like we were it’s going to take you a while to learn the controller, but most games have tutorials to show you and you’ll learn it in no time. I have an 8yr old and a 6 yr old that learned that way and now they are pros. Speed, updating, downloading, etc. have yet to be a problem. Overall we really enjoy playing games on this console & have no issues.",11,english

Aaron,1,I wouldn't recommend getting this xbox,the United States ,20180315,True,  I wouldn't recommend getting this xbox. First off you can tell the box had been opened because of all the resale stickers but everything else looked new so I decided to try it out. I bought this xbox to upgrade from my original xbox one but this is no upgrade. It glitches on every single game I play witch never happened with my original xbox so defiantly shouldn't happen on the newer xbox. Overall is just slower than my orginial xbox.

To the point,  it is freaking slow it freezes in every step of the process, I’m 4 hrs in to the process and it looks far from over. I can’t update the controls because the console is so slow that the controls shut off before the update starts. This is how slow it is.

Derek D.,1,Disappointed in Quality...,the United States ,20180730,True,"  Got this in the mail today, and I was disappointed for a couple of reasons. The power cord is ridiculously short and the HDMI cord is even shorter. The controller seems flumsy, like it will break easily. Plus it is battery operated, which I never read that anywhere in the description. I assumed it was rechargable like others. Waste of my money. Buy a different one!",2,english
Zero One,1,Broken Console by an Indifferent Vendor,the United States ,20180318,False,"  XBox One S is the worst console I have every owned. Laggy, buggy, prone to crashes due to three clunky OS (master, entertainment, gaming). I performed two full factory resets out of the box, four partial factory resets and it ultimately died during the seventh. I played a single game on it and watched a few movies. Sneeze at it: crash. Look at it: crash. Not to mention it is not the momentous improvement as billed over the original model, let alone my tried and true 360. I never regretted buying a 360. It worked. Sure it sounds like a horror movie lawnmower but that's what TV volume buttons are for, right?The One S ensures that all gaming is a scheduled event. Download the game, even the 360 game an emulator runs, reload it 2x so the install completes. Download all the patches that are required. Five hours later, time to play! ""Sorry, something went wrong."" That's an actual error message.If you don't have immediate problems you can wait for trust Microsoft to mess up an update with bugs. They want your machine on all the time so they can crash it before you can sneeze in the machine's direction. Customer support? Check the forum. Look at the forum. Call customer support! It would be more hilarious if I hadn't wasted nearly $300 and 20+ hours of maintenance time. I have maybe an hour a week to game and this console doesn't allow for pickup and play. Rather, you escape into an ecosystem of ambivalence and frustration, where you are leasing ""beta""-level hardware. Then you get weekly updates on all the fun games you don't get to play.",5,english
Margaret,3,Xbox one s didnt late a year,the United States ,20190911,False,  My boyfriend and I got this for my down syndrome brother for Christmas last year 2018. It disnt even last a year. One the headphone jack doesnt work. Two last Thursday when he went to turn on his system it went back to the set up your Xbox one. Got pass the 2 first parts but when it come to updating it said there was something wrong with the update. I tried everything to get it to work for a week end calling Microsoft and they told me he will need to get a new console when he didnt do nothing to it but turn it on and off. I still believe it not the console nor the internet connection especially since my PlayStation ps4 work wonderful with the WiFi. My boyfriend and I are beyond PISS about it because it wasnt even a year before the system apperently wont update.,1,english
Emily Wallace,1,Buy a ps4,the United States ,20190619,False,"  I don't usually write reviews but I have to for this one. Don't buy an xbox one. Don't buy an xbox one s or any xbox console. I have a Nintendo Wii, ps2, 3ds and all of them are fully functional and still work to this day. (My 3ds takes a beating.) I have had my xbox for one year with 7 games on it and last week I started getting error messages. I called up the help line and the xbox guy literally said my xbox one was trash. They refused to fix it because apparently they don't fix my version of the xbox one anymore. (I'd be way more understanding if I had a faulty xbox360!- I'd be bummed but i wouldn't be warning people away.)So not wanting to waste all the games I bought and needing a system for streaming apps I found an xbox one s in relatively good shape and I bought that. Plus my best friend has an xbox one s (my fault) so I'm trapped until next gen.Right at this moment I can't even sign into my account due to actual xbox live issues. It has been an hour.My boyfriend has a ps4 and uses it SO much more than I use my system, and has NONE of these issues. None. This boy never even shuts his ps4 down the safe way.Don't make the same mistake I did. My ps2 still works and that should have been the life experience I needed to stick with ps consoles. Just buy a ps4. Don't risk such a huge investment in a system that has these issues.",0,english
Taylor,1,OMG,the United States ,20191029,False,"  Xbox One is the worst console I have ever owned. Through my life I have owned PS1, PS2, PS3, 64, GameCube, Wii, Xbox 360 and now this literal piece of garbage. This system is so bad that I was highly considering donating it, but then I realized that I would be the jerk that ruined that poor kids life. This being the latest Xbox out to date, is a joke. Whenever I attempt to play (which 50% of the time I cannot because something has to update or the game has to download for 5hours), I feel like I have jumped back to year 1950. How could this system be so bad? How could every other system that I have owned be faster and more efficient than the “NEWEST” Xbox. When I mentioned that you have to download your game onto Xbox for 5 hours - I was not being sarcastic. I buy a disc, and cannot not play it immediately because the game has to install onto the system. Why does it do this? Because even with it being installed (which literally has taken over 5 hours before for COD Modern Warfare), YOU STILL NEED TO INSERT THE DISC TO PLAY THE GAME. Save yourself, and don’t waste hours of your life on this.",0,english
Kyle Ebel,4,Efficient and Easy on the Wallet,the United States ,20190217,False,"  The Xbox 1S is a good console if your looking for an upgrade for the Xbox 1, but don’t have a lot of money. This would be great for Parents and College students who might want to buy an Xbox, for multiple of purposes. It can also be used for beginner streamers. It gives you a good base to start with and comes with good games like Gears of War, Halo series, Cup Heads, etc.Somethings that you might want to know+Is always on, even when you have it off.+I had one incident of miss coloring, but a hard reset fixed it.+It is very customizable, and have a bunch of options for you to mess with.+The voice activation function is very annoying, can turn it off.+No more energy box, just the power cordYou can use twitch, but Xbox has bought it’s own streaming site.If you like Xbox, but just can’t afford the Xbox X this is for you. It has good graphics, and comes with all the things you need to connect it with a TV with an hdmi cable. As like every xbox it can be a good dvd player, netflix device and a casual gaming console. If you are looking for streaming or recording purposes, the console comes with a built in system giving you the ability to stream, and also it comes with inputs in order to capture content. The Xbox 1s comes with 1080p streaming capabilities, you just need the Internet to support it.  I recommend it to anyone looking into this.",0,english

Used it to play through Gears of War and watch a couple movies. Maybe used it for 20h totalI went overseas, came back, and now the xbox refuses stay on, connect to the controller or provide a video signal (apparently its a common issue). IT'S ONE MONTH OUT OF WARRANTY they want me to pay 179 USD (which is more than half the price of it new) to get it serviced. Absolutely not Microsoft. This thing is going in the trash where it belongs.",0,english

If you are thinking of getting this Xbox I Recommend NOT.  I search the solutions of this problem and none of them worked.  Main Excuse Of Microsoft is “Check Your Internet Connection”.  Trust me it’s not the internet,0,english
DJohns,1,There’s better consoles,the United States ,20190409,False,"  The Xbox One S is not a good console at all, the console always freezes and the controllers disconnect quite often. The controller has terrible reaction time with the games you play and the Xbox will crash any time it wants to.
